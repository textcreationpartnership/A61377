            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, <hi>alas,</hi> what are all created beings, and ſublunary vanities, to content the infinite deſires, of an immortal ſpirit? Theſe terrene poſſeſsions are only proportionate to the body; <hi>and can the ſoul feed upon the bodies portion?</hi> 'Tis poor ſupport can be drawn from the abundance of this world, when the ſpirit is departing, to enter into an endleſs eternity. <hi>2.

<pb facs="tcp:64514:6"/>they ought to be practiſed: And if they be evil, why are they profeſſed?</hi> When King <hi>Alexander</hi> had a cowardly Souldier, of his own name, he is reported to have called him aſide, and thus to have ſpoken to him; <hi>Friend, either change thy name, or leave thy cowardiſe.</hi> The like may be fitly ſaid to Profeſſors of Religion; <hi>Either ſh w forth the power of godlineſs in your lives, or do not take upon you the profeſsion of Godlineſs. Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, if ye do not the things which I ſay? Luk.</hi> 6.46.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You are, <hi>many of you,</hi> (I am apt to think) a people under convictions. The clear light of the Goſpel which hath ſhined amongſt you, hath left, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> ſuch impreſſions on your ſpirits, <hi>That you cannot but approve the things that are excellent.</hi> You cannot but acknowledge the wayes of God to be right, and the ſervice of ſin to be abominable. Ask your conſciences (to whom I appeal in this caſe) <hi>if it be not thus.</hi> So that I may ſpeak to you, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the King, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.27. <hi>King</hi> Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, <hi>Believest thou the Prophets? I know that thou believeſt. My brethren, Do you believe</hi> the abſolute neceſſity, and incomparable worth of Holineſs? <hi>Do you believe,</hi> That the fear of the Lord is the beſt wiſdom, and the favour of God the chiefeſt portion? That <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is great gain, and ought to have the <hi>ſupremacy</hi> and <hi>preheminence</hi> above all worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
<pb facs="tcp:64514:7"/>
               <hi>Do you believe,</hi> that the pleaſures of ſin are folly and madneſs; and will end at length in everlaſting deſtruction? <hi>I am perſwaded, many of you believe it.</hi> Now, <hi>Sirs,</hi> it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to ſin againſt convictions; to diſown that in your <hi>converſations,</hi> which you ſubſcribe to in your <hi>conſciences. Happy is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth not himſelf in that thing which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</hi> Rom. 14.22. <hi>To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> Jam. 4.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You are, <hi>moſt of you,</hi> a people of low eſtate, and poor in the world. And will you not ſecure an intereſt <hi>in the true riches?</hi> If you have little, or no, treaſures upon earth; ſhould it not quicken you to be the more induſtrious <hi>to lay up treaſures in heaven;</hi> that you may not be poor in every reſpect? When Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> (as I remember) was led to his <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> there came to meet him a poor boy, that was blind, but had received the knowledge of the truth: To whom the <hi>Martyr</hi> ſpake to this effect; <hi>See to it that you continue to ſerve the Lord, and that you loſe not the knowledge of God; for then thou wouldest be blinde both in ſoul and body.</hi> So let me ſay to thoſe of this rank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you; <hi>Well is it, if you have choſen the good part, which cannot be taken away; if you have in heaven, an enduring ſubſtance: elſe you are poor, both in this world, and in relation to that
<pb facs="tcp:64514:7"/>which is to come.</hi> Study to ſhew your ſelves, men and women approved of God, that it may appear, you are of the number of thoſe whom the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> makes mention of, Chap. 2.5. <hi>Whom God hath choſen, the poor of this world, but rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. You are, <hi>all of you,</hi> a people of ſignal and eminent mercies. And if the mercy of God riſe up in judgment againſt you, <hi>what will be able to plead for you?</hi> If mercy condemn you, how ſore will be your condemnation? Will ye trample upon the bowels of the compaſſion of God? And tread under foot his loving kindneſs? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6, <hi>Do you thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is he not thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee, and eſtabliſhed thee?</hi> I will not multiply the mention of <hi>Particulars:</hi> only there are <hi>two mercies</hi> principally, come at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into my thoughts; which I would have you never to forget.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remember the dayes of old, conſider the years of ſome generations at the leaſt: Ask your Fathers, and they will tell it; your Elders, and they will ſhew it, <hi>That you have been remarkably bleſſed with Goſpel-priviledges, and advantages for attendance upon God, and communion with him.</hi> You have had, for ſome
<pb facs="tcp:64514:8"/>good while together, <hi>a ſucceſsion of faithful and painful Miniſters,</hi> who rightly divided the word of Truth. When ſome other places were, comparatively, in darkneſs; you dwelt in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> a place of light. Keep therefore <hi>an holy ſuſpicion</hi> and <hi>jealouſie</hi> over your hearts and lives, leſt you be found guilty of <hi>receiving the grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. And to that end, let me beſeech you often to read, and meditate with <hi>ſeriouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon, theſe awakening Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſult your late experiences of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. That</hi> was a ſpecial preſervation, which I would have you to keep freſh in your <hi>Memories,</hi> and conſtantly to retain the ſenſe of it, upon your <hi>hearts: When it pleaſed the Lord, in the late dreadful year, to contend with the Nation, by the deſtroying Peſtilence, you were as a fire-brand pluckt out of the burning.</hi> You were expoſed to the <hi>contagion,</hi> as well as other places where it violently raged. <hi>Nay,</hi> more, upon ſeveral accounts, than ſome other <hi>Towns,</hi> which it laid almoſt deſolate. And the Lord was pleaſed only to give you thereby, <hi>an awakening call to Repentance;</hi> and to ſuffer the deſtroying Angel to proceed no further. One houſe amongſt you was infected, and it ſwept away all that dwelt therein: And a ſtop was immediately put to the further progreſs of it.

               <hi>Correcting providences,</hi> and <hi>gracious deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have both of them a Teaching vertue.</hi> They are <hi>the voice of the Lord,</hi> whereby he crieth <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,</hi> unto the children of men, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.10, 11. And this <hi>diſpenſation</hi> which I am calling back to your remembrance, being <hi>a Judgment</hi> allayed with <hi>the mixture</hi> of <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy,</hi> ſeemed in my apprehenſion, to ſpeak thus much unto you: As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>This people are in the way of declining apace from me, and begin to loſe the ſenſe of the</hi> Goſpel doctrines, <hi>wherein they have been taught: And therefore I might juſtly break in upon them in wrath, and conſume them with a ſore deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But how ſhall I give them up to utter ruine and deſolation? How ſhall I lay them waſte, and make them as</hi> Admah <hi>and</hi> Zeboim? <hi>My bowels are turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger: I will yet grant them ſome deliverance: I will wait upon them a while further, that I may be gracious unto them. I will ſee what their end will be, what uſe they will make of this eminent deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> My Brethren, <hi>I queſtion not,</hi> but there are many amongſt you, that <hi>truly</hi> fear the name of the Lord: And <hi>of the reſt</hi> I ſpeak, <hi>not to ſhame</hi> or <hi>accuſe;</hi> But as my dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends, I <hi>warn</hi> and <hi>admoniſh.</hi> And I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect your pardon, for dealing thus plainly; for if you would have me for your <hi>Friend,</hi> you

Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wilde grapes? And now, Go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be troden down. And I will lay it waſte, it ſhall not be pruned nor dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: but there ſhall come up bryars and thorns.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of reſting in a formal courſe of Religion, and of fancying to your ſelves an eaſie way to ſalvation.</hi> But get through convictions upon your hearts, of the neceſſitie of making it <hi>your</hi> very <hi>buſineſs</hi> to walk with God, and of acting with <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>induſtry,</hi> in laying hold on eternal life. <hi>Lazy wiſhes,</hi> and <hi>faint deſires,</hi> an <hi>empty name</hi> and <hi>profeſsion,</hi> and a bare keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the round of ſome outward duties,</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring you into the glorious preſence of

               <p>This portion of Scripture (which I have choſen as the <hi>baſis or ſubject</hi> of the following Meditations) may not unfitly be ſtiled <hi>An Abſtractor Epitome of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> whereby life and immortality is brought to light; wherein the way is revealed for reſtoring fallen ſinners to their primitive happineſs, or conducting ſouls to everlaſting bliſs.

               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>believing that Jeſus is the Chriſt;</hi> an aſſent unto the truth of this principle, that he who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the true Meſſiah and Mediator, ſent of God to be the Saviour of Mankind: So the very Devils believe. As they know there is one God, ſo they acknowledg this principle, that Jeſus is the Son of God, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Redeemer of loſt ſinners. Hence it is that they are ſo unwearied in their endeavors, to hinder poor ſouls in cloſing with Chriſt; and that they labour by all manner of falſe ſuggeſtions to draw their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.24. <hi>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit cried out, Let us alone thou Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, I know thee who thou art, the Holy one of God.</hi> And that herein the Father of lies ſpake the very truth, you will find by the teſtimony of the Spirit of God himſelf, v. 34. <hi>He caſt out many Devils, and ſuffered not the Devils to ſpeak, becauſe they knew him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Believing Jeſus Chriſt, i.e.</hi> a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to the truth of the Doctrines that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which are contained in the Scriptures, the Word of Chriſt, and Preached by Miniſters of the Goſpel in his name. Thus a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may believe, he may own the verity of Chriſts Word, though in the gall of bitterneſs and in the bond of iniquity, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12, 13. <hi>When they believed</hi> Philip <hi>Preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, then</hi> Simon <hi>himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved alſo.</hi> Thus <hi>Nicodemus</hi> believed, before he was inſtructed in the neceſſity, or acquainted with the grace of regeneration: he was convinced by the Miracles wrought by Chriſt, that he was a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſent of God; and <hi>conſequently,</hi> that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which he taught, were the truths of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. As a carnal perſon who never taſted of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64514:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>grace, may have much knowledg in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the will of Chriſt; ſo he may be under ſuch convictions upon his judgment, as in a ſort to approve the Word of Chriſt, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.17.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But laſtly, there is a <hi>believing on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> When a man is ſo powerfully convinced of the evil of ſin, and his own obnoxiouſneſs to the wrath of God; and the heart ſo fully perſwaded of the excellency of Chriſt, and the ſufficiency of his Righteouſneſs; together with the utter inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of all other wayes of deliverance; that thereupon he doth actually cloſe with Chriſt upon Goſpel terms, and make application to him, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelf upon the Son of God for Salvation, and renouncing all things for the enjoyment of him.
<note place="margin">Although believing on Chriſt doth not alwayes ſignify a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith (as, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23) yet for the moſt part it doth; and ſo may fitly be made uſe of, by way of diſtinction. It being obſerved by ſome, that <gap reason="foreign">

He hath a fundamental evidence that he is a child of God, and in covenant with him; here is ſufficient matter, if rightly improved, whereupon to raiſe a teſtimony of this thing. It is faith which brings a man under the favor of God, and the act of believing is a ſure token that the perſon is endowed with the grace or habit of Faith. Spiritual actions, as they muſt proceed from a Divine principle, ſo they are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of that principle from whence they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt</hi> (not with a bare aſſent of the Judgment, but he that believeth it with the heart, <hi>as before</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64514:30"/>own ſoul. He hath not only heard by report of the awakening, convincing, and converting power of the Goſpel (which are a ſtrong witneſs of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine original and authority) but this witneſs he hath within himſelf, as having felt that efficacy. So that he can ſay to the Miniſters, as the men of <hi>Sychar</hi> to the woman, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.42. Now we believe, not becauſe of your reports, for we have found it our ſelves to be a divine doctrine, becauſe it hath ſubdued our hearts, and wrought mightily upon our ſpirits. Or as the ſtranger that commeth into the Church Aſſembly, upon whom the Word is quick and powerful, and ſharp as a two edged ſword, piercing into his boſom and diſcovering the ſecrets of his heart; O <hi>ſaith he,</hi> God is in you of a truth; ſurely this is none other than the Word of the Lord of Hoſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25.

               <p n="2">2. We have the ſinfulneſs of the ſin of unbelief, the horrid and heinous nature thereof.

               <p n="1">1. The mercy provided, or the bleſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, that is, <hi>eternal life.</hi>] What are we to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by eternal Life in this place?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vita aeterna ſumitur.</hi> 1. <hi>Propriè pro beato electorum ſtatu poſt hanc vitam.</hi> 2. <hi>Impropriè ſeu Metonymicè pro viâ ſeu medio perveniendi ad vitam aeternam.</hi> Ravan.</note> I anſwer, 1. <hi>Expreſly, and primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the enjoyment of God in heaven; the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Viſion and fruition of the Lord in glory: the Rivers of pleaſures that are at his right hand for ever: the reward of the Inheritance, commonly ſet forth by this expreſſion, <hi>eternal Life, Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.8. 2. <hi>Virtually,</hi> and <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> all ſorts of ſpiritual bleſſings, that have a tendency to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and are required to fit us for the poſſeſſion thereof: that is to ſay, grace and holineſs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin and reconciliation with the Almighty; the ſupplies of the Spirit for doing the will of God, and ability to perſevere in that way unto the end. Theſe are all included in this expreſſion of <hi>eternal Life:</hi> for they are the firſt fruits and beginnings of it. As glory is but grace in its ripeneſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo grace is glory in the bud and bloſſom: And therefore our Saviour calleth the knowledge
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64514:32"/>of God, eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 3. <hi>This is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to know thee the only trus God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> that is, This is the foretaſt of eternal Life, the way to it, an earneſt peny in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the full poſſeſſion; it is none other than the gate of heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus you are to underſtand it here, in the full extent and latitude of the expreſſion: as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the ſaving mercies conferred upon the Saints on the earth, as well as the crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to be enjoyed in heaven: For in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace (whereof the Text is an abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) God hath made proviſion for the one, as well as the other. He hath not only given Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if men are ſanctified and repent: but hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the ſanctification and repentance of his Elect, that they may be ſaved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterwards receive me to glory.</hi> And accordingly Chriſt the Mediator hath made his purchaſe; he hath not only bought an inheritance to be given to the Saints: but for the Elect of God he hath procured <hi>Saintſhip,</hi> and all the appendices thereof, that they may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that inheritance, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>That's the firſt thing in the Text, <hi>The mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, or the bleſſing conveyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You have the Original or Well-ſpring of this mercy; the fountain of this Bleſſing, whence it is derived: <hi>why,</hi> from the free grace and pleaſure of the Lord; it is his gift. It is not merited and deſerved by us, but freely and graciouſly beſtowed upon us: <hi>This is the record, that God hath given us eternal Life.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein it differs from the reward of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that is the natural product of our ſins, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64514:33"/>this is not the purchaſe of our bolineſs; that is juſtly merited, but this mercifully given: as the Apoſtle obſerveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Wherein the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh, as if he did plainly intend to obviate and prevent the corrupt reaſonings of men. Will ſome be apt to argue, If the wicked by their tranſgreſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve eternal deſtruction, then a Believer by his holineſs doth merit eternal Salvation: Nay, ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> here I muſt have leave to deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; the one indeed is a wages, but the other is a gift.</p>
               <p>We may take a view of the bleſſedneſs, or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Saints, in a fourfold period: and in each of them (in reſpect to us) it is of grace. God hath given us eternal Life.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the eternal counſel and purpoſe of the Father:</hi> As he determined and fore-ordained to bring ſons to glory, ſo it muſt of neceſſity be of grace and love. Who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenſed? What could move the Lord to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign compaſſion for ſome, and to paſs by others of the ſame nature with them, of greater parts and dignity, and in higher place, as to worldly honours and accompliſhments? To appoint an handful in compariſon unto bliſs and glory, to ſet them apart for himſelf; and to leave the reſt of mankind in their undone condition? Surely it was only becauſe it ſeemed good in his ſight: and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led election of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>There is a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64514:33"/>according to the election of grace: and if by grace, then it is no more of works.</hi> It is aſcribed to pure mercy, nothing but mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>For he ſaith to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion. So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the Covenant and Promiſe,</hi> which God hath made of eternal Life, and whereby it is made over to Believers. Pray, whence was the Lord induced to make ſuch a gracious Covenant, but from his own good pleaſure? <hi>It is given to us.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. It is true, the faithfulneſs, and, in ſome ſenſe, the righteouſneſs and juſtice of God, oblige him to fulfil the Covenant, when it is made [<hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.8.] but it was only free love that could incline him to make it, or to enter into this Covenant; and to make publication thereof, to ſome and not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the purchaſe of it,</hi> by the blood of Chriſt. God ſent his Son into the world upon that errand, by his obedience and ſufferings to become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Salvation. And what was the motive that prevailed with the Lord to ſend him? what provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative ſtirred him up to make this Miſſion? <hi>Why, God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. He ſhut up the fallen Angels irrecoverably in the chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he gave not Chriſt to take their nature upon him: but for us men, and for our Salvation, he came down from heaven: and <hi>herein God commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his love to us,</hi> Rom. 5.8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, eternal Life may be conſidered <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64514:34"/>of our Title to it,</hi> and intereſt therein; together with the poſſeſſion thereof: which is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the work of Regeneration. And whence doth this proceed? <hi>Why,</hi> it is a gift, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>He that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who hath alſo given unto us the earneſt of his Spirit.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling: not according to our works, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own purpoſe and grace.</hi> It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>That's the ſecond branch of the Text. <hi>The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this mercy, whence it doth proceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We have the great diſpenſer of this mercy or bleſſing: into whoſe hands it is put to be dealt forth unto Believers. This is Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God; <hi>And this life is in his Son.</hi>] It is put into the hands of a Mediator, and that Mediator is none elſe but the eternally and only begotten Son of God. It is in him upon a threefold account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As in the <hi>meritorious Cauſe,</hi> by whom it is procured: by whoſe death it was purchaſed. As Chriſt bought the Elect of God to be his people and ſervants; ſo he bought eternal Life to be their inheritance: Hence the Kingdom of Heaven is called <hi>the purchaſed Poſſeſſion,</hi> Eph. 1.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is in Chriſt as <hi>in the Repreſentative,</hi> by whom poſſeſſion is taken in the name of Believers, and to their uſe. For when our Saviour entred into heaven, he was not only admitted thither upon his own account: but he took livery and ſeizin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the behalf of his people. He entered <hi>as the fore-runner:</hi> and not for himſelf only, but for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is in Chriſt as in the hands of a <hi>publike Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64514:34"/>or <hi>Truſtee,</hi> whom God the Father hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this very purpoſe; to diſpenſe forth eternal Life, unto thoſe for whom it is prepared. For as the ſouls of men and women are bleſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, ſo that bleſſing is communicated through the hands of the Lord Jeſus. He is God the Fathers <hi>high Steward,</hi> whom he imployeth in the diſtribution of his grace. He ſends him to bleſs his children, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. And what the Spirit doth it is in Chriſt's name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26.</p>
               <p>There's the third particular to be obſerved: <hi>The great diſpenſer of this mercy. God hath given us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is the manner of the conveyance of this mercy; how it is made over to us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ours: <hi>Why,</hi> by vertue of our union with Chriſt. It is given forth by the Son, to them that have the Son, and to none beſides. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Poſitively, <hi>He that hath the Son hath life.</hi>] He hath it, 1. in reſpect of right and title thereto: he hath a good intereſt therein,
<note place="margin">Praeſentia gratiae atleſtatur fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitatem futurae gloriae ſine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio ſequuturam.</note> it is his portion and his inheritance, to which he may warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably lay claim; and for which he may plead as his own. 2. He hath life in the beginning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereof: he hath thoſe mercies which are certain harbingers of glory, and will end in glory. Or, 3. He hath eternal life; that is, he ſhall as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly enjoy it, as if he were already in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: it being an uſual form of ſpeaking, in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64514:35"/>writings of the holy Ghoſt, to mention things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the preſent tenſe, to note the certainty and undoubtedneſs of their futurity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is delivered Excluſively, <hi>He that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi>] that is, 1. He hath not life in reality, whatever he may have in his own conceit and apprehenſion: he may think himſelf to be ſomething, when indeed and in truth he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 2. He hath not life; that is, he is ſtark dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, he is under the wrath of God, he is ſtill an accurſed wretch. So it may be meant, by an uſual <hi>Meiwſis,</hi> whereby leſs is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned than is intended. 3. He hath not life, <hi>i. e.</hi> if he die in that eſtate, it will be evident that he hath it not: he will periſh ſurely, eternally, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably.</p>
               <p>I mainly intend to handle this laſt branch of the Text. For the further clearing of which, there is one previous enquiry to be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> The Queſtion is this. What is meant by a perſons having the Son? Or, How may a man or woman be ſaid to have the Son, that he may have life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For anſw. you muſt note theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The way, whereby the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture doth moſt commonly ſet forth our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Son, it is by <hi>our union with the Son,</hi> or being in him. We are ſaid to have him, by being made one with him. This is evident at the firſt to any one that is verſt in the books of the Old and New Teſtament: that <hi>having the Son</hi> is the ſame thing, for ſubſtance, with that which is frequently called our <hi>union with Chriſt,</hi> or being in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation, to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.] i. e.</hi> to them that have him, by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64514:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>vertue of their union with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.54. <hi>Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> And if you would ſee how this feeding on Chriſt doth contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to a ſinners having eternal Life; you will find it to be, becauſe thereby he hath the Son; which is expreſſed by union with the Son, <hi>v.</hi> 56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And thus <hi>having the Son</hi> ſeemeth to be explained in the following part of this Chap. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>And we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true God, and eternal life. q. d.</hi> this is the way to eternal life, hereby alone you will come to the enjoyment of it: you muſt have the Son, <hi>that is,</hi> you muſt be in him, or united to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By our union with Chriſt (which is the way whereby we are ſaid to have the Son) I underſtand all along <hi>(to ſpeak diſtinctly)</hi> the Oneneſs of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>You may obſerve a difference between theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The making of Chriſt and a Believer one. And, 2. Their being one, when they are ſo knit together. 1.

The term is indeed of a latitude that may comprize both of them, but I ſhall uſe it principally to denote the latter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although in the writings of the Scripture you do not meet with this numerical word of <hi>Union with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64514:36"/>Chriſt,</hi> in the very letters and ſyllables of it; yet you have plentiful mention made of the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby. How often do you read of the Saints <hi>being in Chriſt?</hi> and being put <hi>into Chriſt?</hi> and expreſly in one place, you have mention of their Oneneſs with him, and with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they may be one in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of the Text, being thus unfolded and opened, will afford us this doctrinal Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in order to an intereſt in eternal life, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of thoſe bleſſings which are given forth by Chriſt, in a tendency thereunto, it is of abſolute neceſſity, that we be united unto Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we will have life from the Son, we muſt have the Son: <hi>that is,</hi> we muſt be made one with him. No union with Jeſus, and no communication of life and ſalvation from Jeſus. For, <hi>he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> And therefore you ſhall find, that this is the method and order, wherein the Lord is pleaſed to conduct ſinners to happineſs: Firſt, he doth plant them into Chriſt, and then doth bleſs them in him, and through him,
<note place="margin">Chriſtus habet quod omnibus proſit; ſed ſi non bibitur, non medetur.</note> 
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. So that this is a point of a very momentous nature, which I would preſs on my own heart and yours: that we may periſh everlaſtingly notwithſtanding what chriſt hath done and ſuffered, except we be ingraffed into Chriſt. As life is in him, ſo our ſelves muſt be in him, that we may partake of that life. This is the priviledge which <hi>Paul</hi> did thirſt after, and for which he willingly ſuffered the loſs of all things, accounting them but dung; that he might win

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Introductory Concluſions premiſed, to direct us in the ſtudying of this Doctrine.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO premiſe a little by way of <hi>Introduction.</hi> There are three preliminary concluſions, uſeful to be pondered and ſettled in our thoughts, by way of entrance to the ſtudy of this great truth: and getting an inſight into this ſubject, of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Union, or Oneneſs with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. That this grace of a Chriſtians union with the Son is, <hi>for the intimacy and cloſneſs of it,</hi> one of the deep things of God: one of the great myſteries held forth in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Doctrines of the Bible are well compared by one to the holy waters in <hi>Ezek. cap.</hi> 47, 3, 4, 5. In ſome places they were no higher than the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of a man; but in other places up to the loyns, nay, a great River that could not be paſſed over. In ſome places ſo ſhallow, that a Lamb might wade; but in others deep, that an Elephant might ſwim. So in the truths of God, you have many things eaſie and obvious, that he that runs may read them; the meaneſt Chriſtian may apprehend them: But then other paſſages are ſo deep, that they may exerciſe the ſtrongeſt capacities. You meet with this diſtinction of divine truths, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. There is <hi>milk for Babes,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> for ſuch as are more experienced, and have made ſome conſiderable progreſs in the School of Chriſt. There are plain truths to feed the weakeſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and higher myſteries to exerciſe the greateſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64514:37"/>parts and indowments. And this point of Union with Chriſt is one of thoſe myſteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mark,</hi> I ſay for the intimacy of it, and a through inſight thereinto. As to the matter [or <hi>quod ſit</hi>] it is one of the firſt principles: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a full comprehenſion thereof, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable depth. It is called <hi>a myſtery, a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> Eph. 5.32. It is one of the things which God hath prepared for them that love him: <hi>ſuch as never entred into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. where the Apoſtle primarily ſpeaketh of theſe ſpiritual bleſſings, though that paſſage is uſually applyed to the kingdom of glory. This Union is ſet forth, for myſteriouſneſs of it, by that Oneneſs which is between the Father and the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. ſufficiently importing, that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable depth.</p>
               <p>This is needful to be premiſed, on a fourfold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we may begin the ſtudy of this point, and you may be careful to manage your attendance upon this doctrine, with an holy and humble ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and admiration of the wiſdom of God, in this glorious contrivance: That God ſhould not only redeem loſt ſinners by the death of his Son: but make them one with his Son. How ſhould it fill us with aſtoniſhment, in the contemplation hereof? That is a poſture of ſpirit, very ſuitable to an enquiry into the nature of this tranſcendent priviledge. Well may a perſon cry out as <hi>S. Paul</hi> on a like occaſion, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God,</hi> Rom. 11.33.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we may the rather be induced, in our meditations on this Doctrine, as to ſearch diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Scriptures, ſo to confine our thoughts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64514:38"/>and ſpeculations thereupon to the plain revelations and diſcoveries made in the Scriptures. Not to launch forth by our inquiſitiveneſs beyond what is contained therein, and made known to us thereby. For,

Or perhaps (which is worſe) ſplit our ſelves on the rock of ſome uncouth opinion, bordering upon blaſphemy; inſtead of embracing the truth: as ſome perſons have done, when they ſought to be wiſe herein above what is written. As far as we have the light of the Word to go before us, we may proceed with ſafety, in our enquities of this nature:

For it is a great myſtery, a matter of pure revelation: the full manifeſtation whereof is reſerved for heaven: and it requireth a ſpecial illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirit to give us any competent inſight into it. So much is evident from the words of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20. <hi>At that day, ye ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> At that day, <hi>that is,</hi> when the Spirit is poured out from on high,

               <p n="3">3. That hereupon you may be quickned, to ſet upon this ſtudy with prayer: with the earneſt and fervent lifting up your hearts to heaven, that God would anoint your eyes with ey-ſalve, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this truth. That he would open your minds and judgments to underſtand the Scripture in this particular: and lead you into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and acknowledgment of this myſtery.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That in order to the getting acquaintance with this Doctrine, you may be convinced of the neceſſity of putting your ſelves under the promiſe which God hath made, to reveal the ſecrets of his Covenant to his ſervants. For this is one of thoſe ſecrets, a great myſtery: and upon that account moſtly ſtiled a <hi>myſtical Union.</hi> And you know, the way to get under the verge of that promiſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nulla in diſcendo mora eſt, ubi ſpiritus ſanctus Doctor adeſt.</hi> Beda.</note> is by indeavouring to maintain an holy dread and fear of the Majeſty of heaven upon your
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64514:39"/>hearts: &amp; not daring knowingly, to ſin againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> This is the very reaſon, why many poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of low parts in compariſon with others, can ſpeak more clearly and ſavourily of theſe things, than ſome profound Doctors, who are ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs: becauſe the promiſe is not made to great parts and learning,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ille qui cum puritate animae le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git Scripturas, plus proficiet quam ſi enodare tentaret myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria multis commentariis.</hi> Acoſt. Jeſ.</note> but to ſuch as have a reverential awe and regard of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God upon their ſpirits. The Lord doth often hide theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and reveal them unto babes. <hi>Why?</hi> becauſe it ſo pleaſed him; and becauſe he hath promiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in theſe leſſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>The meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way.</hi> Again, v. 12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him he ſhall teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe.</hi> And therefore <hi>mark what I ſay:</hi> Humility, ſelf-emptineſs, and poverty of ſpirit, together with a due dependance on the teachings of God, will ſtrike a greater ſtroke in acquiring the knowledge of theſe Leſſons, than the choiceſt accompliſhments of parts and learning without them. A conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reſpect to plain truths and precepts, is the way to learn hidden myſteries, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's the firſt Concluſion to be premiſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. Although the Union of a Chriſtian with the Lord Jeſus, is in it ſelf a myſtery, not eaſie to be attained as to right apprehenſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet it is a point of very great concernment to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64514:39"/>be ſtudied; and a clear inſight thereinto will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompenſe all the pains you can take in the ſearch of it. So that the difficulty of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhuld not deter us from a diligent enquiry into it: but rather ſtir us up to purſue it, with all our might and induſtry. It is a point wherein a man cannot <hi>with ſafety</hi> be ignorant. It is incumbent upon us, as we tender our everlaſting welfare, to get right apprehenſions of the ſubſtance of this thing. A miſtake herein may occaſion our eternal undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore when Chriſt had treated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. of the mixture there is in the viſible Church, in many parables together: How that ſome are <hi>in the Church</hi> who are not <hi>of the Church;</hi> that there are many ſeem to be members of the body, who are not ſpiritually united to Chriſt the head of the body (for that is the drift of the parables, though delivered in other words) how doth he cloſe his Sermon upon that ſubject? See <hi>v.</hi> 51. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, have ye underſtood all theſe things?</hi> As if he had ſaid, It doth infinitely concern you to get a good underſtanding in this matter: you cannot ſafely be in the dark, as to this Doctrine: Let theſe things ſink deep into your hearts, and be much pondered in your thoughts. Hence the holy Ghoſt is ſo much upon it, and doth frequently mention, not only the excellency and need of Jeſus Chriſt, but likewiſe the neceſſity of our Oneneſs with Chriſt, or being in him.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous thing to have falſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our minds concerning this union, or to be ignorant of it, for three Reaſons eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is the want of a right knowledge, and due conſideration of this very thing which is the cauſe of the ruine of many thouſand ſouls.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64514:40"/>Amongſt thoſe that live within the pale of the Church, and have heard the joyful ſound of the Goſpel, a great number periſh by ſplitting upon this rock. They apply the vertue of the death of Chriſt to themſelves, without ever minding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are in Chriſt. They hope to be ſaved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his account, and ſo go on ſecurely to hell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhelter of thoſe hopes; becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidered the nature and neceſſity of being united to his perſon. See the very riſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, how they plead themſelves into a fools paradiſe, in expectation of being pardoned and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through Chriſts blood; becauſe they never minded if they had the Son or not; if they were in Chriſt or no, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26, 27. <hi>Then ſhall ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſay, We have eatten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou huſt taught in our ſtreets: But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are: depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Obſerve their miſtake from the anſwer that is returned them; <hi>I know you not whence you are</hi>] as if he had ſaid, You are utter aliens and ſtrangers unto me, perſons with whom I never was acquainted: Though you heard my Word, yet you were never ingraffed into my body, though you were never ingraffed into my body: though you have eaten and drunk in my preſence, yet you were not implanted into me; nor ever had any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with me. And who are thoſe which thus deceive themſelves? why, many, very many, as in that parallel Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. I think, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may give us cauſe to ſuſpect, they are the moſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a dangerous thing to have falſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Union with Chriſt; becauſe this is the great fundamental bleſſing upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is built: and other ſpiritual bleſſings have a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64514:40"/>dependance hereupon. So that ſee to it, that you ſtudy this Doctrine, and judge aright concerning it: for if the foundation fail upon which our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is bottomed, all the ſuperſtructure muſt of neceſſity vaniſh that is erected upon that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All other attainments are as nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this. If the leading mercy fail upon which others depend, we muſt undoubtedly fall ſhort of thoſe other mercies, which have their dependance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Why ſirs, Union with Chriſt is the very <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of conſolation, and the leading mercy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, A mans profeſſion is nothing, and all his common indowments and priviledges are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: they will not ſignifie a jot, as to ſave him from deſtruction: he cannot eſcape the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hell, except he get into Chriſt, and abide in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is dangerous to be ignorant of this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and it much concerneth us to get a ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof: becauſe this Doctrine, <hi>of late,</hi> hath been notably corrupted, and perverted. It hath been abuſed to the countenancing of ſome mens <hi>(even)</hi> blaſphemous aſſertions, which they have vented, under the notion of high attainments. They have endeavoured to break down that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is between Chriſt and his people, and to turn the whole ſubſtance of the Goſpel into <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories,</hi> upon pretence of opening this Union. And it concerneth us to be well inſtructed and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>preſent truths;</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> phraſeth it, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. truths which are moſtly perverted in the preſent time, or that need ſpecial vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64514:41"/>in the preſent age, wherein we live: in the defence whereof God calleth us to ſtand up againſt the adverſaries. If we would not be led aſide by the error of the wicked, and fall from our own ſtedfaſtneſs, as we muſt labour to grow in grace, ſo to increaſe in the knowledge of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
               <p>So much for the ſecond Concluſion to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. Inſtead of curiouſly prying into, and over-much inquiſitiveneſs after this Myſtery, and the manner of this Union, further than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures of truth; it ſhould be the great deſign of mens ſouls to ſecure it unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to make it evident that they are ſharers therein. Herein lieth the marrow and fatneſs of this glorious priviledge, when we can perſonally appropriate it to our own ſouls, and ſay: This is a mercy, whereof we are partakers. Elſe, what ſweetneſs can we taſt in the contemplation thereof, whilſt our ſelves are ſtrangers thereunto? This is the very counſel of the Apoſtle, in another caſe, to his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3, 4, 5. They were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in him: <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith he, your buſineſs lieth in reflection upon your ſelves, to prove that Chriſt is formed in you. The like advice I would give in this preſent affair. And we ſhould the rather give diligence herein, upon a threefold account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe hereby we ſhall be the better inabled, to perceive the real meaning of what is delivered in the unfolding of this Myſtery: We ſhall eaſier diſcern the import of all the particulars mentioned in the opening of it: when we have found it made good upon our own ſouls, and feel ſomewhat
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64514:41"/>wrought within us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the doctrines which are taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. For <hi>Sirs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Poſtquam coelitus ſpiritu houſte, in novum me hominem nativitas ſecunda reparavit, mirum in modum protinus confirmare ſe dubia, patere clauſa, lucere te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebroſa, &amp;c.</hi> Cyp. Ep. 2. ad Donat.</note> a little experience of the power of godlineſs will notably help a man to diſcern clearly into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of godlineſs: it will ſerve inſtead of many Commentators for the unfolding of divine truths. If a Scholar ſhould make a large and eloquent Oration, to ſet forth the ſweetneſs of honey; a little taſte of it would contribute more to a right underſtanding thereof, than many learned Lectures without it. So when perſons have taſted the grace of God in this Union, matters will be plain and eaſie unto them, that ſeem dark and intricate and full of obſcurity unto others. In what a puzzle was <hi>Nicodemus</hi> as to the Doctrine of Regeneration, in his underſtanding, for want of feeling the work of Regeneration upon his heart? So that he cried out, <hi>How can theſe things be? Joh.</hi> 3.4, 9. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> exhorteth us <hi>to taſt and ſee, Pſal.</hi> 34.8. that is, endeavour to taſte, that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know, and underſtand the goodneſs of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is to employ theſe excellent truths, which God hath graciouſly revealed, to the end for which they are revealed to us. The Lord hath not opened the treaſures of his Wiſdom, in declaring theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, only to feed mens fancies, and to fill their heads with ſpeculations: but to excite and exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate us to get an intereſt in theſe mercies: that we ſhould perſonally apply them to our ſelves, and make ſure our claim and title thereto. You will find this <hi>apparently</hi> to be the end of the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64514:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>of this very Doctrine, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written, to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> Theſe things] <hi>that is,</hi> theſe high myſteries of ſalvation afore-mentioned; that it is in the Son, and to be enjoyed by vertue of our union with the Son. I have written them, that you may take them home to your own conſciences, and paſs judgment upon your ſelves, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of theſe words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we learn the nature of this priviledge, and do not ſecure it to our ſelves, it will but tend to the heightning of our condemnation. So that better for us we had never known it, or heard a word concerning it: for this very thing will aggravate our contempt of the grace of God; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon it will be a continual torment upon our ſpirits. What a cut will this be to a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when he cometh to die, to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I knew that there was ſuch a glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge prepared for the children of men, and yet would never preſs after the enjoyment of it: I preferred the pleaſures of ſin, and ſatisfaction of ſome baſe luſts before it: I was offered the Son, and life and redemption through his blood, and would not labour to ſecure it unto my ſelf, ſo that now I am undone eternally and irrecoverably? See how Chriſt ſets forth mens wickedneſs on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26. And it is evident, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will take advantage from hence, to be a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor, to be a worm gnawing upon the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of a mans ſpirit. How have I hated inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof? O what madneſs have I been guilty of, to know theſe things, and not to make them ſure unto my ſelf? <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13.</p>

               <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf, in the Sermons which he preached, hath made mention of a twofold union with him: or of two ways how men and women may be in him. 1. By way of <hi>viſible Profeſſion,</hi> or external adbaeſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as a dead branch or ſprig is in the Tree, though it nothing partake of the ſap derived from the root: as a glaſs eye or wooden leg is in the body, though they do not partake of life with the body, in any degree whatſoever. 2. By way of <hi>ſpiritual ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and implantation; when they are in Chriſt ſo as to be quickned by Chriſt, and receive nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him: as a living fruit-bearing ſlip or ſience is ingraffed into the ſtock. This diſtinction you have, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman: Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64514:43"/>more fruit.</hi> Which words are a parable, wherein, 1. Chriſt compareth himſelf to a Vine; and it is a very <hi>pat</hi> compariſon, both in regard of the mear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lowneſs of his outward appearance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no form and comelineſs that he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in that reſpect: as the vine is the moſt deſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, in outward view, among ſt the Trees of the garden. And in regard of his real worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; although the vine hath no beautiful ſhape, yet it is a very uſeful and excellent plant: ſo the Lord Jeſus is the chiefeſt of ten thouſands, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a plant of renown. But principally Chriſt is here reſembled to a vine, in regard of the ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the branches, and the juicy influence that from him is imparted unto the branches: it is by Chriſt they are upheld, and by communications from him they are maintained. 2. God the father is likened to the Husbandman; by whom the vine is planted and dreſſed; by commiſſion from whom Chriſt was ſent upon his work, and furniſhed with all things requiſite thereunto, and by whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are graffed into him. 3. And perſons in the viſible Churches are ſignified by the branches in the Vine: Of which, <hi>ſaith our Saviour,</hi> there are two ſorts; ſome that are dead and withered, and others which are living and bring forth fruit. And both of them may be ſaid to be in him; the one ſort by way of profeſſion, the other by way of ſpiritual implantation. Every branch <hi>in me</hi> that beareth not fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will open this diſtinction, in each of the members of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is Union with Chriſt, or a being in Chriſt by way of <hi>common Profeſſion,</hi> or outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerence only: when yet they have no ſaving inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, or benefit by him. Thus all that own
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64514:43"/>the Chriſtian Religion, and have a ſhew of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are in him; though perhaps they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the life and ſubſtance of godlineſs. They are ſaid to be in his Kingdom, in the Church which is his Body; and out of that Kingdom they ſhall be gathered and caſt into Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41. <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend,

You read expreſly of their being ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, who yet drew back unto perdition, and trampled that blood under their feet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy of, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing?</hi> i.e.
<note place="margin">There is a ſanctification to the purifying of the fleſh, and a ſanctification to the purifying of the conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. The ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion external to the purifying of the fleſh conſiſteth in the mans ſeparation from the world, and dedication unto God's ſervice by calling and Covenant, common to all the members of the viſible Church, &amp;c. <hi>Dickſ.</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64514:44"/>import of the place; for it is an evident alluſion to the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſprinkled on the whole body of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whereby they were ſanctified and ſet apart unto the Lord; or as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their covenanting with the Lord: although with many of them God was not well-pleaſed, they continued weltring in their ſins, under the power of their unbelief and other wickedneſſes, notwithſtanding. Now as they are ſanctified by Chriſt, ſo in a like ſence it may be ſaid they are in him: they belong to him, as his diſciples and followers by way of profeſſion. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66.</p>
               <p>Concerning which Union with Chriſt, by way of common profeſſion, or external adhaeſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will intreat you to mind theſe four <hi>Poſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſition.</hi> 1. The principal bonds or ligaments whereby this union is made up, by which perſons are thus knit unto Chriſt, do mainly conſiſt of four things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. An approbation or acknowledgment of the doctrines of Chriſtianity.</item>
                  <item>2. An external ſubjection to the Ordinances of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>3. Some common workings upon their hearts and ſpirits.</item>
                  <item>4. A meaſure of reformation in their lives and converſations.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Let us a little touch upon them ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt bond of this Union, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adhaeſion, is <hi>an approbation and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the doctrines of Chriſtianity;</hi> ſo as to aſſent unto the truth, and confeſs (at leaſt) the goodneſs and excellency of them: ſo as to cloſe with them,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64514:44"/>in oppoſition to all contrary ways of Religion. It is not enough to the eſtabliſhment of this Union, that a man doth hear the word of Chriſt; ſo may a Heathen do, out of curioſity; ſo may a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Mahometan,</hi> to blaſpheme and cavil: but at leaſt there muſt be ſome kind of reception and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the word. Thus the carnal Profeſſors of whom the Apoſtle maketh mention (for of ſuch he ſpeaketh under the name of <hi>Jew's</hi>) <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18, 21. It was this which made them <hi>Jews</hi> outwardly;

                     </gap> been baniſhed with them by the decree mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.2.</note> though they were no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly inſtructed, nor taught the truth as it is in Jeſus; yet they had ſome knowledge of the mind of God, and were convinced of the truth and excellency of the Law of the Lord; ſo as to ſubſcribe to it, and to own and approve it as ſuch. This made them Chriſt's people at large, by way of profeſſion. And this muſt needs be one of the ligatures of that Union; for ſuch as avowedly reject the fundamental doctrines of Chriſtianity, are not ſo much as Chriſt's ſeeming friends; but open enemies to his crown and dignity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be an <hi>external ſubjection to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt:</hi> ſo as to afford their preſence at them, and outward compliance with them, and attendance upon them. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are the badges of Chriſt's followers,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacramenta,</hi> ut &amp; alia inſti u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta divina, <hi>ſunt figna pioteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva fidei.</hi>
                  </note> as well as means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his grace into their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64514:45"/>ſouls. And if a people belong to him at all, they muſt at leaſt wear his livery. So that when perſons live in the open neglect, or contempt of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Inſtitutions of the Lord Jeſus, or think they are arrived at ſo high a pitch as to be above Ordinances; they do thereby declare themſelves, to be ſo far from the truth of grace, that they are not arrived to a ſerious proſeſſion. <hi>Above Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and below Chriſtianity.</hi> Such have not ſo much as Chriſt's livery upon them; for this is one of the bonds of a common union. Thus <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized into Chriſt, and for a while held fellowſhip with the Diſciples, and ſo in a ſort did belong to Chriſt; till afterwards he apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and diſcovered his rottenneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. So far the loweſt rank of hypocrites ordinarily go. It is true, they have no ſpiritual communion or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt in his Ordinances: but they are many times pretty-conſtant in attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ordinances. So thoſe carnal <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom God owneth in this reſpect to be his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58, 1.2. And therefore the Apoſtle calls men off, from truſting in this, to mind the grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and Converſion upon their hearts: for theſe priviledges avail not to a ſaving union with Chriſt, but a new creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is uſually ſome <hi>common workings upon their hearts and ſpirits:</hi> as now, convictions in the conſcience of the evil of ſin, ſometimes an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon their ſouls to give up themſelves to be the Lords: only a beloved luſt hindereth the performance of it. Poſſibly many common graces of the Spirit are conferred upon them, in which reſpect they are ſaid to be made <hi>partakers of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> for ſo far a carnal Profeſſor may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64514:45"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. The holy Ghoſt may ſtrive with a profeſſed enemy to the Kingdom of Chriſt;
<note place="margin">There are ſome Converts <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> from the world to the Church, who yet ſtick in their naturals; and are not in the ſenſe of ſin fled unto Chriſt for refuge, nor converted from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſaving grace. <hi>Dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> but when he ſhall moreover work ſome remarkable effects upon a ſinner; as terrors in apprehenſion of the wrath of God, deſires to be ſheltered under the wings of Chriſt, that he may eſcape that wrath; ſo that he joyneth himſelf out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to his people, then he becometh a <hi>ſeeming friend,</hi> though he proceed no further.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt bond which I ſhall mention, of this common union with Chriſt, is <hi>ſome degrees of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the life and practiſe.</hi> When perſons live and lie weltering in groſs pollutions of the world, they do apparently belong unto the world: they do openly proclaim themſelves to be the very children of the devil. If a man belong to Chriſt but by profeſſion, there muſt be ſome meaſure of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wrought: there muſt be an actual abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe wickedneſſes whereby the name of Chriſtian is openly contradicted. As real holineſs and cloſs walking with God is eſſential to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Diſciple indeed:</hi> ſo a cleanſing of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the cup and platter (as our Saviour calleth it) is required to make a man a <hi>Diſciple but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi> And thus far they commonly go, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. They retained their doggiſh and ſwiniſh nature ſtill, as is evident from their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, v. 12. <hi>The dog is turned to his vomit again, and the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire:</hi> and yet <hi>they eſcaped the pollutions of the world,</hi> and that <hi>through the knowledge of the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64514:46"/>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 20. Although the doctrines of the Goſpel had not a <hi>ſaving effect</hi> upon their ſouls, yet they had a <hi>real effect:</hi> though their natures were not <hi>transformed,</hi> yet their lives in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars were <hi>reformed:</hi> their converſations were cleanſed from groſs and ſcandalous abominations. That's the firſt Poſition touching this matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſ.</hi> 2. It is a very great priviledge and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, conſidered in it ſelf, for a man or woman to be taken thus neer unto Jeſus Chriſt, and in this ſenſe to be united to him; <hi>namely,</hi> by way of external adhaeſion. To be ſeparated from the Heathen to be his people, and to be made to differ from the profane world and the notoriouſly wicked; who do avow their ſins openly in the face of men, and declare themſelves ſubjects unto the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Though it be not the beſt of priviledges, yet it is a great priviledge; though it be not a mercy to be reſted in, yet it is a mercy thankfully to be acknowledged: it is no way to be ſlighted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of it as ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>What advantage hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumciſion?</hi> that is, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit doth ariſe by being a member of the Church of Chriſt? what profit is it to be a Jew outwardly, a Diſciple by profeſſion? into which relation cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did give them ſolemn entrance, it was the Ordinance for initiation. Is this nothing? or is it a priviledge of a low nature? No, in no wiſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, do not thus eſteem it. It is an eminent mercy, there is <hi>much</hi> advantage by it <hi>every way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſay, wherein lieth the advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in Chriſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> In four things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64514:46"/>
               <p n="1">1. Chiefly and primarily, becauſe hereupon they are ſet under the means of grace, and tenders of ſalvation. They have eternal life ſet before their ſouls, and upon the terms of the Goſpel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them. Hereby they do enjoy the word of Chriſt, the Oracles of God; and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are the places wherein the Lord Jeſus himſelf is to be found of them that ſeek him: and which are the conduit-pipes through which he doth uſe to convey ſpiritual grace and bleſſings, to ſuch as thirſt after them. The remainders of the light of nature are enough to leave a ſinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable in his condemnation, when he doth not live up to that <hi>light;</hi> but they can proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they can make no diſcoveries of the path of ſalvation: But now perſons in the viſible Church have theſe things revealed before their eyes: they have Chriſt ſet forth that they may know him: and his excellencies diſplayed that they may love him. So that it is a merciful priviledge in this reſpect; Nay, if the fault be not in themſelves, it may bring them to Chriſt in a ſaving way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael. <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, and as for his Judgments they have not known them. Praiſe ye the Lord. q. d.</hi> Here is matter of praiſe and abundant thankſgiving. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby perſons do enjoy communion with ſuch as are real Saints, and ſervants of Chriſt in ſincerity: which may be of excellent uſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to emulation, and ſo to ſave their ſouls. They have the benefit of the ſociety of the godly, to be an incouragement unto them to ſerve the Lord indeed: and the advantage of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64514:47"/>as a copy for imitation.
<note place="margin">Multum reſert quibuſcum vix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eris.</note> They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their counſel for admonition; and many times partakers of their provoking conferences, to incite and ſtir them up to become ſuch as <hi>they</hi> are. They have a ſhare in their inſpection and watchfulneſs over them, whereby oftentimes they are reſtrained and kept in due bounds. And ſo it is a ſignal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this reſpect. As by fellowſhip with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contracting friendſhip with them, men learn their wayes, and get a ſnare unto their ſouls: ſo by communion with the Saints, perſons are in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of learning their ways, and ſaving their ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.4, 5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyl, which ſhall not break my head:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nihil tutius amico monitore.</note> that is, (by an uſual <hi>Mei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>) it will abundantly tend to my ſpiritual good, and to the promoting and carrying on my eternal welfare. As coals are kindled by other burning coals: ſo are the ungodly many times by hearty counſel, and holy walking, and the like, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to quicken and inflame ſuch as have fellowſhip with them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence it is that they do <hi>in a ſort</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that ſpecial care which God taketh of his Church: and receive ſome drops of thoſe bleſſings which Chriſt doth ſhowr down upon his Church. You know, that although God by a general provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth mind and govern the whole creation [he feeds the ravens when they cry, and gives meat to the beaſts of the field] yet he hath a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the affairs of his Church: he maketh peculiar proviſion for them, reſerving his dainties
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64514:47"/>in ſtore for them. Now by this external adhaeſion unto Chriſt, and being in the viſible Church, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may have a ſhare in thoſe mercies; and the out-skirts of thoſe bleſſings may fall down upon their heads. As one that is but a ſojourner in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and no ſtated fixed member of it, may taſte of many good things, which the good man of the houſe prepared for his own children. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a people are ſaid upon this kind of neerneſs, to have God himſelf nigh unto them: that is, to be under his ſpecial care, even the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though multitudes of them went no further than profeſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.14. <hi>The children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>a people neer unto him.</hi> Deut. 4.7. <hi>For what Nation is there ſo great, that hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is, in all that we call upon him for?</hi> And it ſeemeth to be mentioned as a priviledge of the whole viſible Church. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. That <hi>the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her aſſemblies</hi> [upon the Church of Chriſt, whereof Zion was a type, and upon all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregations thereof] <hi>a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night.</hi> The meaning is this, God will in a ſpecial manner be a guide unto them, and undertake for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and protection: He will lead them and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, as he did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their travels out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he went before them in a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night. So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.5. <hi>As birds flying, ſo will the Lord of hoſts defend Jeruſalem, defending alſo he will deliver it, and paſſing over he will preſerve it.</hi> As birds fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] that is, ſwiftly and ſpeedily, at the cry of his people he will come as in an inſtant, before the adverſaries are aware. Or as a bird doth hover o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64514:48"/>the neſt to preſerve her young ones, ſo will the Lord watch over his people to ſecure and deliver them. Theſe and ſuch promiſes are made to the Church in general, and even carnal Profeſſors, by vertue of their ſtation in the Church, may have a ſhare in this ſecurity &amp; theſe deliverances. As when the godly joyn in confederacy with the wicked, they may be made to ſmart under the judgments that are ſent upon the wicked: ſo Profeſſors by their fellowſhip with the godly, may taſte of the bleſſings imparted unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a great priviledge, becauſe hereby men are often reſtrained from venting many corruptions that otherwiſe would have prevailed: &amp; from turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide into ſuch ſins and abominations wherein others wallow. And ſo they are prevented and kept from contracting much guilt which otherwiſe would be contracted by them. And this is no ſmall advantage. Reſtraining grace is a mercy, though ſanctifying grace is an higher. And God doth make uſe of this neerneſs to Chriſt, as a reſtraint or bridle to ſtop ſinners in their carier: hereby they are <hi>purged from their old ſins.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. That's the ſecond Poſition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Poſition.</hi> 3. When men and women are only thus united unto Chriſt, by way of viſible profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or external adhaeſion, though they may abide with him for a time, and ſeemingly cleave unto him; yet at laſt there will be made a ſeparation betwixt them; and this union will be diſſolved and broken aſunder. As it is a <hi>diſſoluble Union</hi> for the nature of it,

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64514:48"/>by one means or another. When a ſoul is in Chriſt by a ſpiritual implantation, he ſhall never be parted from Chriſt; but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon union will be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the cords of it ſnapt aſunder. If a dead branch ſtick to the Vine for a ſeaſon, yet at length the Gardiner cometh with his pruning-knife and catteth it away. This is the very Metaphor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the diſſolving of this Union is ſet forth, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. i.e.</hi> he cuts off with his pruning-hook, and caſteth them into the fire. If they do not live through the vine, they ſhall have no further being in the vine.</p>
               <p>And there are three principal ways, how this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is made, or this ſort of union is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By their Apoſtacy and drawing back from the profeſſion of the Faith, in days of tribulation and trial: for they are the uſual ſeaſons wherein car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſors diſcover themſelves. When God doth exerciſe his Church under diſcriminating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, as ſore afflictions and perſecutions for the truths ſake, then it appeareth who are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned to the truth.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64514:49"/>pare off their exuberancies, and that ſuch as are approved may be made manifeſt. Then hypocrites moſtly unſtrip themſelves of their covering, and are diſcovered to be what they are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. <hi>When tribulation or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by they are offended.</hi> Mark it, They were only united to Chriſt by external adhaeſion: &amp; when the winter cometh, and the froſt nippeth them, they wither and fall away. In this ſenſe we hold falling away from grace, and apoſtarizing from the faith,
<note place="margin">Amici ob utilitatem una cum utilitate diſſolvuntur; namnon ſui mutuo erant, amici, ſed uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis.</note>

                  </gap> of the Faith. This may ſerve to direct you how to judge of <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and backſliders: either they fall but partially, and God in due time will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, and bring them back by weeping croſs: or if they depart totally and finally from Chriſt. The reaſon is, becauſe they were but dead branches in Chriſt, and ſo they drop off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This common union is diſſolved, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the ſpiritual judgments of God upon their ſouls: by giving them up to themſelves, and delivering them over to the will of Satan. When perſons continue long unprofitable in the Church; under the Ordinances, and are not ſpiritualized nor bettered by them; God is provoked thereby to withdraw the very ſtrivings of his Spirit from ſuch; and to let looſe the reins of their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which formerly were kept under; to give them up to vile affections, and a reprobate mind, that they may make it appear to whom they really belong: even to the God of this world, the ſpirit that ruleth in the children of diſobedience. You
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64514:49"/>read that thus he dealt with the Heathen, for not living up to the dictates of the light of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24, 26, 28, 29. Much more may it be feared, when perſons abuſe the light of the Goſpel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the grace of God therein manifeſted in vain, or turn it into wantonneſs. For as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>The earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſſing from God. But that which beareth thorns and bryars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> By the earth underſtand the ſouls of men and women, likened to the earth, for their natural ſtupidity. <hi>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord:</hi> 2. Becauſe of their tendency downwards unto earthly things: But in this place eſpecially, becauſe of the ſouls activity and fructifying vertue, it will bring forth ſomething either good or evil. By the rain that cometh oft upon this earth, <hi>is meant,</hi> the doctrines of the word, which fall as the rain, and diſtil as the dew upon the face of the ground, for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering thereof. Now, that earth which drinks in this rain, and beareth thorns and bryars [<hi>i. e.</hi> if they live ſtill in their ſins, defiled with their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are not ſuch as walk anſwerably in ſome meaſure to the means they are under] is nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curſing [unto this ſpiritual curſe of being given up to themſelves, to commit iniquity with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby they are ſealed up to deſtruction: to the curſe of barrenneſs, <hi>Never fruit grow upon theſe ſouls any more.</hi> See alſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.8, 11, 12. This ſhould have a mighty influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us, to make us watchful over our hearts, that we be not barren or unfruitful in the vineyard of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:64514:50"/>
               <p n="3">3. This Union will be certainly and ſolemnly diſſolved, by pronouncing the ſentence of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment. If the hypocriſie of ſuch be not diſcovered until the laſt, then it will be made known in the face of all the world. Chriſt will then rend them from him, however they may hope to ſhelter themſelves under his wings. Then the Lord will judge between cattle and cattle, between one branch and another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.49, 50. <hi>At the end of the world, the Angels ſhall come, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt, and ſhall caſt them into the furnace of fire.</hi> Mark it, They ſhall be then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from amongſt the juſt; intimating that now they are together as tares and wheat in the ſame field, as good fiſh and bad in the ſame net, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving branches and dead in the ſame vine: but then the wicked ſhall be removed from their ſtation, and caſt into hell. <hi>That's the third Poſition.</hi> That this Union with Chriſt will ſooner or later be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Poſ.</hi> 4. The ſtate and condition of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are thus united to Chriſt, by way of external adhaerence only, and do not aſpire nor preſs after a further intimacy with him, and a neerer conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that do not improve this priviledge that they may be indeed, what they profeſs to be, is a very wretched eſtate, and a miſerable condition. It is worſe than the condition of open enemies to Chriſt; ſuch as are groſly ignorant of the truths of the Goſpel, and that never profeſſed to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Scripture calleth it a <hi>wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition:</hi> that is, very wretched, exceeding, miſerable. God doth hate them with a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and loath them with a full abhorrence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16.17. <hi>So then, becauſe thou art
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64514:50"/>luke-warm, and neither hot no cold</hi> [neither a ſincere Profeſſor of Religion, nor a profeſſed enemy to Religion; neither faithful to Chriſt, nor an open adverſary againſt Chriſt] <hi>I will ſpue thee out of my mouth. Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich and increaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Better for ſuch carnal Profeſſors, that continue in that eſtate, and reſt contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, without getting higher; I ſay, better for them they had never known the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then to take up their reſt in this common union; and not to improve it to a purſuance after a more inward conjunction with Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. The ſadneſs and deplorableneſs of their condition will appear in theſe four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they do thereby put themſelves into the greateſt unlikelihood, and incapacity of being ever ſavingly wrought upon, of any that live where the word of Chriſt is publiſhed: and the glad tidings of Salvation are made known to the children of men. There is more hopes of the converſion of the moſt debauched wretches, that live in a profeſſed ſubjection to the devil, than of thoſe who have long continued only carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. As when they apoſtatize they do uſually become the moſt bitter enemies of Chriſt; ſo it is the hardeſt thing to draw them effectually unto Chriſt. This is none other doctrine than our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath taught, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the publicans and barlots go into the kingdom of God, before you.</hi> They go into the Kingdom of God] <hi>that is,</hi> they are eaſier prevailed upon, to ſubject themſelves to Chriſt's government: it is a harder thing to work upon your ſouls, than upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64514:51"/>theirs: there is more probability of their being converted, than of yours. Who were theſe to whom Chriſt ſpeaks? <hi>Why,</hi> they were the chief Prieſts and Scribes and Elders, men that were thought to be <hi>ſome bodies</hi> in the Church, that were had in great eſtimation of the Church, that ſeemed to be pillars in compariſon; that made a fair ſhew; but reſted therein, as being ſtrangers to the life and power of godlineſs. Mind it, <hi>ſaith Chriſt,</hi> I ſay unto you; verily I ſay unto you; <hi>q. d.</hi> It is an undoubted truth, let it ſink deep into your hearts, that publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and the harlots [the vileſt of people] go into the Kingdom of God before you. It will ſeem no wonder, that ſuch are in the greateſt unlikelihood of being ſavingly wrought upon, if you mind theſe three Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider,</hi> That theſe dead branches in Chriſt, or carnal Profeſſors, do commonly thereupon maintain a good opinion of themſelves; and get a ſtrong confidence thereby, that their eſtate is good. They think themſelves well enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore will not eaſily be perſwaded to look after a ſaving intereſt in the Redeemer: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuppoſe their intereſt is already ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Kings are wont to have their fools, and <hi>Solomon</hi> was a great King, and his fool is the ungodly, that provoketh the Lord to wrath, and neglects to provide for eternity, and ſelleth his ſoul for a trifle. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. <hi>They that be whole need not the Phyſitian;</hi> that is, Such as have a good opinion of themſelves, do not ſee their need of Chriſt's righteouſneſs; they will not hunger and thirſt after it, as being full already.

And the firſt is a matter of very great difficulty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider,</hi> That ſuch as are in Chriſt by viſible profeſſion only, are moſt likely to have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſeared as with an hot iron: ſo that thoſe awakening truths which ſerve to rouſe up other ſinners, produce little or no effect upon their ſouls. By continuance in ſin under the preaching of the World, and conſtant attendance upon Ordinances, men become Sermon-proof, and Prayer-proof, Sacrament-proof, and Affliction-proof. Scarcely

Before they were dead in ſin, and now they are dead in ſecurity likewiſe: To their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hardneſs is added a contracted hardneſs. And who are they of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh? why, ſuch as are <hi>clouds without water:</hi> that is, who make a ſhew of Godlineſs, but have nothing of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: who have the form, without the power of it. To them the word of the Lord proveth an obdurating word: that maketh their hearts fat, and their ears heavy, and ſhutteth their eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert and be healed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider withal,</hi> That God is uſually provoked by ſuch mens barrenneſs and unproficiency, utterly to depart away from them, and ſo to bind them over unavoidably to condemnation: to <hi>ſwear in his wrath, that they ſhall never enter into reſt, Heb.</hi> 3.10, 11. So that he will deal with them no further, in order to their repentance and ſalvation. For this is the very method of Gods diſpenſations of this nature, firſt men reſiſt the Spirit, which he ſent to knock at the door of their hearts, and then he calleth away his Spirit from them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. Firſt,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64514:52"/>they neglect to hearken to the grace of God, that ſhould lead them to repentance, and ſo he will wait to be gracious no further: but ſealeth them up in a ſtate of impenitence.

               <p n="2">2. The condition of theſe unfruitful branches in Chriſt, is miſerable above that of others, in reſpect of the intolerableneſs of the damnation that will befal, and the ſore torments that will be inflicted upon ſuch. All ungodly ſinners will be puniſhed <hi>everlaſtingly,</hi> but ſuch as ſeemed to cleave unto Chriſt, but yet ſerved the devil, will be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>moſt ſeverely,</hi> and made to drink of the dregs of the cup of God's indignation: as ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt moſt light, Goſpel-light, and under means of grace denied to others: which are the main ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of ſin.

               <p>And beſides, I might have added, that the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch will be the greater, becauſe of the reproach and ſcandal which they bring upon Chriſt, and his ways.

May Chriſt ſay unto them, if my ſervice were evil, why did you call your ſelves may ſervants, and go under my name, and liſt your ſelves into my family? and if it be excellent indeed, why did not you ſerve me in truth and in ſincerity? <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. <hi>When the King came in to ſee the gueſts, he ſaw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he ſaith unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having

You know, though there is a very neer conjunction, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereupon, between the Husband and Wife that are married together; yet it is but a relative oneneſs: their individual properties remain diſtinct, notwithſtanding. Such is this Union of a ſincere Chriſtian with the Lord Jeſus; they are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and married together, and ſo become united. For by ſuch <hi>umbrages</hi> taken from external things, God is pleaſed to ſet forth this high myſtery; that it may be better apprehended by us; that it may be eaſier let into our underſtandings.</p>
               <p>Under this Head, I ſhall intreat you heedfully to mind and obſerve three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Union of the Saints with Chriſt, is not a transformation of either into the eſſence or ſubſtance of the other:
<note place="margin">Noſtra &amp; ipſius [Chriſti] con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctio nec miſcet perſonas, nee confundit ſubſtantias: Sed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus conſociat, &amp; confoederat voluntates.</note> either of Chriſt into theirs, or of Believers into his eſſence. They are not ſo made one as as if there were a ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al alteration, or commixtion therein: as if their perſons or natures were ſo contempered together,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64514:56"/>as to be made up into one. A ſincere convert is <hi>one with the perſon</hi> of the Mediator, but they are not thereby made <hi>one perſon:</hi> as ſome have vented their blaſphemies, that they are Chriſted with Chriſt, and Godded with God, and ſuch like expreſſions, that would make the heart of a ſober Chriſtian to tremble, and his ears to tingle at the mention of them. This oneneſs is not to be underſtood groſly and carnally, as the <hi>Capernaites</hi> miſtook it, but in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as Chriſt himſelf doth interpret it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56, 63. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> How is this to be underſtood? <hi>Mark</hi> v. 63.

                  <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing; the words that I ſpeak, they are ſpirit and life.</hi> As if he had ſaid, theſe things are to be taken in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a carnal manner. Indeed it is ſo undeniably evident, that it is not to be meant of a corporal union, that I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the confutation of ſuch uncouth notions. Chriſt and a believer are not ſo made one, but that they retain their natures diſtinct, and their perſonal properties diſtinct, notwithſtanding that union: they have different places, properties, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Chriſt is corporally in heaven, <hi>the heavens muſt contain him, till the time of the reſtitutions of all things,</hi> and many of the members of his myſtical body are ſtill militant upon the face of the earth. He is the Redeemer, and they are the redeemed, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. To the Lord Chriſt doth juſtly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64514:56"/>appertain all worſhip and homage, <hi>All ye Angels of God worſhip him, Heb.</hi> 1.6. But it were monſtrous and hateful idolatry, to give it unto the Saints, who are our fellow-creatures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 14, 13, 14, 15. The Lord Jeſus is ordained and conſtituted to be the Judge; and Believers are a part of the perſons to be judged. It is true, they ſhall fit as <hi>Aſſeſſors with Chriſt,</hi> in paſſing ſentence upon the wicked; but firſt they muſt ſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Judgment-ſeat, and receive their acquittal, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. I might multiply paſſages of this ſort, if it were needful. So that this Union is not a perfonal, or corporal oneneſs with Chriſt, but it conſiſteth in the neer relation which they have unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it followeth plainly by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary; that it is a groſs miſtake of ſuch perſons who would gather from a Believers oneneſs with Chriſt, that they are perfectly freed from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin. <hi>Sirs,</hi> Chriſt is holy and pure, a Lamb without ſpot, and blemiſh, he never kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For their union with him is not a confornd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their beings, as if they were made one phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical perſon with Chriſt; but it lieth in their neer relation unto Chriſt. There hath been much poyſon of late years vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, by wretches of profligate principles,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64514:57"/>who turn the grace of God into wantonneſs. Let them commit never ſo many curſed abominations, yet they will plead that they ſin not, becauſe Chriſt is in them. But though Chriſt be in the godly (not in ſuch whoſe heart walketh after their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable things) and the godly are united to him in a ſpiritual way, yet they do not loſe thereby their perſonal beings and operations. This oneneſs with the Son of God doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe a mans freedom from the reign of ſin, and the allowed practiſe of it; but it may ſtand together with the remainders of corruption; it is not altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with many failings and infirmities in the converſation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6, 8. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs</hi> [if any ſin be our way, and courſe, wherein we travel, and allow our ſelves] <hi>we lie, and do not the truth:</hi> And on the other hand, <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember this in the third place, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we call this oneneſs of the godly with Chriſt, <hi>their neer relation unto him;</hi> yet there is a great deal of reality in it: Chriſt and his people are united <hi>truly,</hi> and <hi>verily,</hi> though <hi>not corporally.</hi> You muſt not look upon this grace of Union, as if it were a bare notion and imagination that hath its exiſtence and being only in the fancies of men; but there is an oneneſs indeed, between the Lord Chriſt and his ſervants, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am the true vine: q. d.</hi> As truly as there is a <hi>natural union</hi> bed tween the vine and the branches, ſo there is an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpiritual</hi> betwixt me and my Diſciples.

Indeed the benefit of it

But the relation it ſelf extends to all the generations of mankind.

And theſe are the perſons who are in him. It is for them only he prayeth, that they might be one with him; and therefore unto them peculiarly doth this priviledge belong, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe in me through their word. That they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> Mark it, it is affixed to Believers, <hi>that they may be one in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How are Believers the ſubjects of this union? I anſwer, on a fourfold account.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Solely, and excluſively.</item>
                  <item>2. Univerſally, and comprehenſively.</item>
                  <item>3. Entirely, and undividedly.</item>
                  <item>4. Formally, under that reſpect, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Believers are the ſubjects of this Union, <hi>ſolely and excluſively:</hi> It is a part of the hidden Manna, which none taſte of but Gods hidden ones, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.3. Carnal Profeſſors have no lot nor portion in this matter; they may enjoy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64514:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>great advantages by having their ſtation in the Church, but only real Saints, and luch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, are ingraffed into Chriſt, the head of the Church. God doth give forth ſome ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies promiſcuouſly &amp; indifferently, to the good and bad, to the righteous and wicked: but there are other priviledges peculiar unto the righteous; and this of implantation into Chriſt is one of them, whereby he doth manifeſt himſelf unto his own, and not unto the world. How can this be, ſaith <hi>Judas</hi> (not <hi>Iſcariot</hi>) <hi>How is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world; Joh.</hi> 14.22. and mark our Saviours anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto him, if a man love me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him; q.d.</hi> We will be united and knit to ſuch a one, and thereupon maintain a conſtant communion and intercourſe with him: which is a way of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of our ſelves, which the world knoweth not of. The world is ſhut out of Chriſt's prayer for this mercy, and it is confined to believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 9. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It belongeth to believers, <hi>Univerſally and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively;</hi> that is, to all of that ſort and number, whether they are weak Chriſtians or ſtrong: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are more eminent in the Church, or of a lower eſteem. My brethren, this grace of One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Chriſt, is not a dignity conferred upon ſome eminent Saints, whereby they are advanced above their fellows; but this honour have all the Saints. If there be true juſtifying faith, but as a grain of muſtard-ſeed (as our Saviour ſpeaketh in another caſe) it putteth a man into the poſſeſſion of this priviledge. It may be the comfort of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64514:61"/>and pooreſt of the people of God upon earth, that however men deſpiſe them, yet they are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the King of Kings, to the only begotten Son of God. You read of <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> who are the loweſt rank of Believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. It may be improved as a point of wonderful conſolation, by poor drooping ſouls that love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity: When your corruptions ſtruggle within you, and you are violently aſſaulted by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from without, and thereupon are afraid how you ſhall be able to hold out, and to keep on in the way of godlineſs: when your ſpirits are ready to ſink under your burdens; indeavour to raiſe them up again with this meditation: The Lord Chriſt is my Husband, why ſhould I fear? He is ingaged to preſerve me, for I belong to him, nay I am in him. See and ſtudy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Union appertaineth to Believers <hi>entirely and undividedly.</hi> My meaning is this, the whole perſons are the ſubjects of this Union, and every part of them: not only their ſouls, the ſpiritual and immortal part, but their very bodies which are made of the duſt of the earth. For, as the grace of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> or ſanctification where it is poured out upon a perſon, it maketh an entire change both in body and ſoul: ſo doth the grace of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> reach to the whole man, to the body as well as to the ſoul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>What, know ye not that your bodies are the members of Chriſt? q. d.</hi> This is a known truth, a foundation principle, you muſt not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it: you ſhould be well inſtructed in this Point, that you may be careful not to defile your bodies; that it may quicken you to glorifie Chriſt with your bodies, as well as with your ſpirits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. At the reſurrection the bodies of the Saints
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64514:61"/>ſhall be faſhioned and made like to Chriſt's glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body; and here upon earth they are knit to his perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Believers are the ſubjects of this Union <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> that is, under that very conſideration, as ſuch: <hi>quatenus</hi> Believers. For the grace of ſaith is the principle which God doth peculiarly honour in this very buſineſs; to make up our union with Chriſt; or to knit a perſon and the Lord Jeſus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Whom he hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. And therefore our Apoſtle applyeth the doctrine of my Text, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that believe, in the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that ye have eternal life.</hi> How ſhould Believers know it hereby? Why, becauſe Believers have the Son; by believing they are in the Son; <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe they believe.</p>
               <p>That's the third Branch of the deſcription, the proper ſubjects of this Union, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is the foundation of this Union, on which it is bottomed: and from whence it doth ariſe; namely from their intimate conjunction with Chriſt. <hi>It is that ſpecial relation which Believers have to the Lord Jeſus, ariſing from their intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him.</hi>] Or, from the cloſneſs of their being joyned together. This is well to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as a material point; for firſt there muſt be <hi>unition</hi> (as one noteth) before there can be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Firſt, they muſt be brought together, and muſt be linked and faſtened one to the other, before they can become one together. At leaſt in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conjunction muſt precede: for Union doth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64514:62"/>reſult or flow from it, and hath a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereupon. As it is in marriage, the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance for illuſtration of this myſtery, Firſt, the man and woman are brought together, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one to the other, and thence their union doth ariſe; they become one fleſh. So it is in this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grace, firſt Chriſt and a Believer are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then they become one. This conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſo cloſs and in imate, that it is called a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glewed unto Chriſt, ſo the word ſignifieth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned</hi> [

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereupon they are accounted as one with Chriſt.</hi> Being made ſo, they are reckoned and eſteemed as ſuch; and accordingly made partakers of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever advantage doth accrew thereby, and doth grow upon this root of Oneneſs with the Mediator. It is not an empty name, and an airy appellation, which is hereby attained: but believers are anſwerably eſteemed and dealt with, in all ſorts of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

When God doth go forth in his providence twoards the children of men, he findeth the wicked in their ſins; polluted in their blood, under the curſe of the Law, and ſo there is a curſe interwoven with his proceedings with them: but when he looketh down upon Believers, they are found <hi>in Chriſt:</hi> They are reckoned as one with the Redeemer; and that in a fourfold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>

It is true, in themſelves they are deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, of a mean extraction and original, and God might refuſe to have any regard to them: in reſpect of their Apoſtacy, they are polluted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and ſo the Lord might abhor them: but he takes a view of them in his Son, and ſo his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions run out towards them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one: and that the world may know,

He taketh of his, and doth ſhow it (or communicate it) unto them: becauſe they are parts of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their fellow-ſervants, all the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Adam,</hi> are warned of God, thus to judge concerning them; and accordingly to ſuit their carriage and actions towards Believers. They are apt to reckon them as the dung of the earth, as the off ſcouring of all things, as the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons under the Sun: but God will have them to know, that they are one with Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. <hi>That the world may know, that thou haſt ſent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64514:63"/>me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> The world] that is the inhabitants of the world: or principally in this place, the wicked of the earth: it is a leſſon wherein it concerneth them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. That's the firſt general conſequent of this Union. Being one with the Son of God, they are to all intents and purpoſes ſo accounted of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond general effect of this Union with Chriſt, is the change of a mans ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Hereby their ſpiritual ſtate is fundamentally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>] ſo that of children of the wrath of God, they are made objects of his favour, and delight, and complacency: in whom he takes pleaſures. Inſtead of the curſe of the Law under which they lay, they are put within the verge of the Covenant of peace and reconciliation: inſtead of fire-brands of hell, they are made heirs of a crown of righteouſneſs. You know there is a threefold change wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a perſon, in order to conduct him to everlaſting bliſs. 1. There is a change of the nature, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of the perſon: the frame and temper of the heart muſt be altered, and turned from ſin to holineſs; from the power of Satan to the living God. 2. There is a practical change in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, from living after the fleſh to a walking in the Spirit, and minding the things of the Spirit. 3. A change of the ſtate and condition, which we are now treating of; and this is fundamentally wrought by a mans union with Chriſt. This change of the ſtate is ſtilled in the Scriptures, <hi>A tranſlation of a ſinner out of the kingdom of Satan, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 1.13. And by the grace of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this tranſlation is originally made and brought about. Mark, I ſay, <hi>originally and fundamentally;</hi> for although juſtification and adoption are a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64514:64"/>change likewiſe in the ſtate of a ſinner, yet I aſcribe it <hi>originally</hi> to union with Chriſt; becauſe thoſe mercies are rivolets which flow from this fountain. And you will find the holy Ghoſt attributing it hereunto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> The ſtate of nature is a ſtate of aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtrangedneſs from God; then ſinners are afar off from his favour and the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: but when they are implanted into Chriſt, this alienation is removed, and they are brought nigh unto God. This is a point of very great weight and moment, and therefore diligently to be heeded and ſtudied. So that I will open it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what largely for theſe three reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe upon the change of the ſpiritual ſtate of our perſons, doth depend the gracious accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our duties and performances. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtant method of God's acceptance of them, firſt he hath reſpect unto the perſon, and then to the ſpiritual work and obedience which is tendered by that perſon

Why? becauſe the perſon ſacrificing is a wicked, ungodly ſinner; and the Lord judgeth mens actions by their ſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is a matter ſeriouſly to be weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt number of perſons, who call themſelves Chriſtians, do ſeldom or never think of it. They go on in ſin and periſh eternally, for want of laying to heart this very thing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould give diligence the rather to ſtudy it; becauſe it is neglected by the moſt. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it as an ordinary thing with carnal people, when conſcience is a little awakened, when they are brought into diſtreſs by ſickneſs, or ſome other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64514:65"/>ſore affliction; they will cry out with a kind of bitterneſs for their evil wayes, and ſeemingly melt with ſorrow for ſome actual miſcarriages: but not one of many will mind his ſpiritual ſtate. Thus it was with <hi>Micah</hi> the Idolater, when he heard his mother curſe and ban for the mony that was ſtollen from her: theſe curſes ſtartled his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and made him to vomit up the ſweet morſel wch he had ſwallowed down: he minds that <hi>wicked action,</hi> but never once conſiders his <hi>ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and ſo goeth on in other ſins notwithſtanding, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.2, 3, 5. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was troubled, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon ſome of his evil ways: and profane <hi>Eſau</hi> grieved becauſe he had diſpleaſed his Father by his ſinful actions: but ſcarce one of an hundred crieth out of his ſad condition. Nay commonly they are ſo far from it, that they will be ready to fly in a mans face, that doth but make mention thereof. When you have convinced a wicked man of his evil life, and brought him to an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a courſe of ſin, wherein he walketh: if thence you begin to ſpeak of his eſtate in ſin, of his being an enemy to God, a child of his wrath, and a wicked perſon, he will defie the words. No, will he ſay, I love the Lord, and God knows my heart is good, <hi>and the like.</hi> See how fowl they fell upon Chriſt, for touching upon this ſtring; When he told them of their wretched condition that they were not of God, but of their father the devil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Thou art a Samaritan,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and haſt a devil,</hi> Joh. 8.44, 47, 48. They could not endure he ſhould meddle with that matter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It concerneth you to be well inſtructed and ſettled in this particular of your ſpiritual ſtate God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; becauſe when the ſpirit of conviction doth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64514:65"/>powerfully prevail upon a mans heart, ſo as to turn him effectually from ſin, and to bring him to a ſound and ſincere converſion, it doth ever end in <hi>conviction of the ſtate of ſin.</hi> As conviction uſually beginneth in ſome particular actual wickedneſs, ſo it alwaies endeth in a diſcovery of that wicked and damnable condition, into which the ſinner is brought. Thus it was with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>For I was alive without the Law once, but when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came, ſin revived and I died;</hi> that is,

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had a good conceit of my ſelf, as to my ſtate and condition, however conſcience might now and then check me for ſome failings and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al miſcarriages, yet I was alive, without the Law, <hi>i.e.</hi> before I had a clear underſtanding of the Law, in my own apprehenſion I was a child of life, I thought my ſelf ſure of ſalvation: but when the commandment came in the life, and power, and vigorous workings of it.

So in the return of the Prodigal, mark how far the conviction proceedeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. <hi>I periſh.</hi> Not only I am a diſobedient Son, that have ran away from my father, and waſted my Patrimony; But if I continue in this condition I am undone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> as the fore runner of the ſpirit of adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>You have not received the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage again to fear.</hi> Mark it, not again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64514:66"/>that once they had received it, that all who are ſavingly converted muſt firſt be under it. When is the holy Ghoſt a ſpirit of bondage? <hi>Why,</hi> when he doth diſcover to a mans ſoul his wretched and miſerable condition: when he doth not only ſhew him his work wherein he hath exceeded, but doth alſo make him ſenſible of the loſt eſtate wherein he is involved: when he cauſeth a ſinner to ſee that he is a child of the wrath of God, bound over to anſwer to the demands of the juſtice of God, obnoxious to the everlaſting and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vengeance of the moſt high; and raiſeth fears and terrors in the ſoul in apprehenſion thereof; ſo that he ſees it neceſſary that his ſtate be altered. The holy Ghoſt <hi>Sirs</hi> may be a ſpirit of conviction, as to ſundry acts of ſin, when he is not a ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: for this relates to the ſtate of ſin: which is alwayes an antecedent to ſound a converſion. And therefore, <hi>as I ſaid,</hi> I will open this point of the change of a mans ſpiritual ſtate in ſix parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a twofold ſtate or condition of mens ſouls, in reference to ſpiritual and eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The ſtate of nature, and the ſtate of grace, as they are uſually called. The ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expoſedneſs to the wrath of God: and the ſtate of favour and reconciliation with the Lord. That of alienation from God, and that of friendſhip and fellowſhip with him. A ſtate of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Lord, and of ſlavery to the devil: Of liableneſs and obnoxiouſneſs to everlaſting death, and the ſtate of heirſhip, and title to the kingdom of heaven. You read often of them in the Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64514:66"/>6.17, 18. <hi>But God be thanked, that ye were the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin.</hi> There's the ſtate of nature. And <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Being then made free from ſin, ye became ſervants of righteouſneſs.</hi> There's the ſtate of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Now therefore, ye are no more forreiners and ſtrangers</hi> [that's the ſtate of alienation from the Lord] <hi>but fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of faith</hi> [this is that of friendſhip and communion with God.] That is the firſt thing to be noted, as to this matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe two eſtates as to matters of ſalvation and condemnation, are comprehenſive of all the poſterity of mankind; without exception of any. They do take in the whole compaſs of the children of men. My meaning is this, that there is no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle condition: there is not a man or woman upon the face of the earth, but muſt of neceſſity fall under one of theſe two ranks. Either he is a Saint and ſervant of God, or a vaſſal and ſlave to the devil: either he is an heir of heaven, or a firebrand of hell. And, <hi>pray Sirs,</hi> let us apply it diligently unto our ſelves, and often ſay in our hearts; One of theſe two is the condition of my ſoul: if I am not a child of God, and in covenant with him, it will neceſſarily follow that I am a child of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; for there is no third eſtate. If I be not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and called to be a Saint, it cannot otherwiſe be, but that I am in the gall of bitterneſs; and if I die in this condition, I drop immediately into hell. As there are but two places into which all nations ſhall be ſent at the end of the world, <hi>that is,</hi> heaven and hell; the place of eternal life, and that of everlaſting puniſhment: ſo there are but two ſtates in which all are comprized during their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the world; either they are Gods friends,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64514:67"/>or his adverſaries: ſtill in their ſins, or delivered from their ſins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> The whole world] that is all other perſons beſides us, of what rank and quality ſoever. And that is a pregnant Text, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.2. <hi>All things come alike unto all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean: to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner: and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Mark it, all people in the world are caſt by the holy Ghoſt into two ranks, or companies: either they are righteous, or wicked: clean, or unclean; good, or ſinners. There is no middle condition, or ſtate of neutrality, upon a ſpiritual account. And indeed there is ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, from the reaſon and nature of the thing: becauſe the diſtinction which is between theſe two eſtates, is ſuch as we call a difference of contradiction in ſome reſpect, ſuch as is between the negation and affirmation of the ſame thing; which cannot poſſibly admit of any third or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle eſtate whatſoever,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>If you will rather ſay, they are <hi>privative oppoſita,</hi> yet the argument holds good: for ſuch admit not a middle <hi>in ſubjecto capaci.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oppoſitorum duorum privativè cum unum non ineſt, neceſſe eſt alterum ineſſe ſuſceptibili.</hi> Aquin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Privatio euim eſt circa certum genus contradictionis.</hi> Alex. de Aleſ.</p>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the Son hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life; and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Mark it, here is a difference of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, betwixt believing and not believing. You cannot poſſibly pitch upon a man, but either he believeth on the Son
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64514:67"/>and ſo is in the ſtate of grace; or he believeth not on the Son, and remains in the ſtate of wrath. They who are regenerate and converted, have the promiſe of ſalvation, and ſuch as are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and not converted, ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven. Here is a kind of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of contradiction, between converted and not converted. And ſo I might inſtance in other qualifications. That is the ſecond thing to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to the change of a mans ſpiritual ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve in the third place, That theſe two eſtates upon a ſpiritual account, are utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible, and inconſiſtent one with the other: and cannot upon any hand ſtand together. Plainly thus, they cannot both appertain to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at the ſame time. It is altogether impoſſible that a man ſhould be in the favour of God, whilſt he is in league of amity with his corruptions: that he ſhould be in the kingdom of Chriſt, and under the prince of darkneſs together. This is a truth ſo plain and obvious, at the firſt view, that one would think it ſhould be needleſs to preſs it: But I inſiſt upon it the rather, becauſe there are ſecret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the hearts of the children of men, to the contrary. Their inward thoughts are that they may ſerve the Lord, and be ſubjects of the devil together: that they may be vain, and earthly, and ſenſual, and follow the courſe of the world; and yet be the people of God notwithſtanding: That they may drink, and revel, and be wanton, and the like; and be in the ſtate of ſalvation too. You ſhall find theſe are the ſecret thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of mens ſpirits, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor judgment, and pervert equity; they build up</hi> Zion <hi>with blood, and Jeruſalem with iniquity: The heads
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64514:68"/>thereof judge for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for mony: Yet they will lean upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord amongſt us?</hi> They flatter and ſooth up themſelves, that they were ſervants of <hi>Jehovah</hi> the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, although they ſerved divers luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and turned aſide into crying wickedneſſes: that the Lord was on their ſide, and they belonged to him, though they openly eſpouſe the intereſt of ſin. But alas <hi>Sirs,</hi> it can never be; theſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are vain and ſottiſh. <hi>Mark</hi> how peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Saviour aſſerteth the contrary, backing that aſſertion with forcible argument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other: ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon; q.d.</hi> It is a ſottiſh thing to entertain ſuch a fond conceit, as if you could join both intereſts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Laws of Chriſt and the commands of ſin, are diametrally oppoſite one to the other: if the affections run towards the one, they muſt of neceſſity be withdrawn from the other; nay ſet againſt the other; for they are directly contrary. And beſides, where God accepteth of the heart, he will have the whole heart: where he is ſerved truly, he muſt be obeyed entirely and univerſally, with the whole ſoul. So that never dream of ſuch a thing, as making a commixtion of theſe two; It is as eaſie to joyn together light and darkneſs, heaven and hell; as to make a conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, between Chriſt and <hi>Belial.</hi> The words of <hi>Joſhua</hi> are very pertinent to this purpoſe, when the people ſeemed to promiſe ſo affectionately and reſolvedly, that they would ſerve the Lord, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.19. <hi>And</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64514:68"/>
                  <hi>ſaid unto the people, ye cannot ſerve the Lord; for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give your tranſgreſſions nor your ſins;</hi> that is, unleſs you forſake your corruptions, you cannot; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you deteſt and caſt off your idols you cannot; whilſt you are in confederacy with ſin, and before you have renounced the hidden things of diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, you cannot be the Lord's ſervants. He is an holy being who will have no communion with the workers of iniquity. Perhaps you will walk in ſin, and hope to make amends for all by crying to God for forgiveneſs; you will ſwear, and curſe, and ly, and defraud, and commit adultery, and profane the Sabbath, and cry God forgive me: But <hi>Sirs</hi> be is a jealous God, and will not forgive you; as long as you go on in a courſe of impenitence, he will never pardon your tranſgreſſions. Poſſibly you will walk, as the generality do, in the vanity of your minds, and wallow in all ſorts of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and filthineſs, and then call upon God to have mercy on you: Alas poor ſouls be not deceived, He will <hi>not be merciful to any wicked tranſgreſſor, Pſal.</hi> 59.5. So that whilſt you ſerve ſin, you cannot ſerve the Lord. That's the third thing to be noted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Remember this withal, That the ſtate of all perſons by nature, as they are in themſelves, and as they came into the world, is an accurſed eſtate: a ſtate of utter eſtrangedneſs from God, and of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to the indignation of the Almighty. <hi>Mark,</hi> I ſay, this is the condition of all perſons, whether Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, learned or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whatever priviledges they enjoy, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their lot is caſt; this is their ſtate by nature, to be under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>What then? are we better
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64514:69"/>then they? No in no wiſe, for we have before proved, both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin; q.d.</hi> Is this the ſad condition of the heathen, and of the infidel world only, to be under the guilt of ſin and the curſe of the Law? No, it is the condition of every Son and daughter of <hi>Adam.</hi> Are the Jews, we that are viſible members of the Church, in a better ſtate than others in this reſpect? No, we are all involved in the ſame wretched condition. There is not a perſon amongſt us, but may lay his hand upon his heart, and appropriate it to himſelf, and ſay, this was my condition: and if I have nothing to plead for my exemption, beſides my birth priviledge, the name of Jew or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and the like; this is my condition, <hi>to be under ſin.</hi> Not only to betainted with ſin, but under ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> under the guilt of it, and under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to it. All the poſterity of mankind are by nature condemned perſons, in a damnable eſtate: and if God ſhould take them away in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would be actually damned and periſh for ever. Sin would lie upon them, and they would fall under it, and ſo it would ſink them irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably into deſtruction.

Certainly, if any man upon earth could have freed himſelf from being involved herein, it might have been <hi>Paul;</hi> who had as much to plead as any, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>He was circumciſed the eighth day,</hi> that is, according to the ordinance of God, he was ſolemnly admitted into the viſible Church: <hi>Of the ſtock of Iſrael,</hi> to

And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</hi> Mark it, here is the great matter of enquiry, whether they are ſheep, or goats; righteous, or wicked; in the ſtate of grace, or ſtill abiding in the ſtate of nature. It is true, the Lord Chriſt will make an exact ſcrutiny into mens ways and carriage, <hi>he will bring every work in to judgment, and render to every one according to his deeds:</hi> But thoſe works will be lookt into, as an evidence of their ſtate; and the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the actions do much depend upon the ſtate of the perſon acting.

               <p n="6">6. In the ſixth and laſt place, to bring it home to our purpoſe, obſerve, that this change in a mans ſpiritual ſtate is fundamentally brought to paſs by his union with Chriſt: it is wrought by vertue of being ingraffed into Chriſt. Then is a ſinner put into another ſtate and condition, when he is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the old ſtock, and put into the true vine: when he is taken out of the wild Olive, and inſerted into the good Olive-tree. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> Chriſt is the head and maſter of the whole party of God's peculiar people; as Satan is the prince of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience, ſo the Lord Jeſus is the king of Saints, the Prince and Captain of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom they belong; and when they are in him, then they belong to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28, 29. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female</hi> [that is, ſuch things as theſe, Country, Sex, and Nation, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition of life, make no difference on a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual account; but union with Chriſt, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] <hi>but you are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> [one myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body by vertue of conjunction with him] <hi>And if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abraham's <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe;</hi> then is your ſtate changed, from children of wrath to be inheritors of a kingdom.</p>
               <p>That's the ſecond general product or conſequent of union with Chriſt. Thereby a mans ſpiritual ſtate is fundamentally changed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence doth redound a right to all the bleſſings of the Covenant. <hi>Hereby the benefits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64514:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>are effectually applyed to their ſouls.</hi>] So ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that believers have a title thereto, and may plead their intereſt therein: they may come unto the Lord with an holy boldneſs, and challenge thoſe bleſſings as their own. They have not only liberty to pray for them as mercies which they want, but with an holy reverence and humility, they may put in their claim to them; when they are united unto Chriſt the Son of God. The very juſtice of God is ingaged to anſwer their ſuit, as well as his compaſſion. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> when a man is knit unto Chriſt, all things that are Chriſts do of right belong unto that man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. <hi>All things are yours, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, <hi>or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come: All are yours, and ye are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's.</hi> Mark it, all things are yours; that is, in reſpect of title to them, and the benefit of them. Upon what ground is that title bottomed? why upon your oneneſs with Chriſt: therefore all are yours, becauſe ye are Chriſts. As the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which a woman hath in the goods and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her husband, doth ariſe from her being united to the perſon of her husband: ſo the right which any have to the poſſeſſions of Chriſt, and the mercies which he hath purchaſed, doth flow from their oneneſs with the perſon of Chriſt. Firſt, we muſt be his, before we have a right to any thing that is his. This is a known principle, That if we would receive any benefit by the redemption which Chriſt hath purchaſed, it muſt be applyed unto us: Now this application is made effectually by our oneneſs with Chriſt. It is the Spirit <hi>by whom</hi> the application is made, and union with Chriſt is the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64514:71"/>way <hi>wherein</hi> or whereby that application is made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</p>
               <p>And therefore you muſt obſerve, there are three wayes how the benefits of redemption are applyed to the ſouls of men and women.</p>
               <p>There is an
<list>
                     <item>1. External and doctrinal application.</item>
                     <item>2. Internal but conditional application.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an external or doctrinal application, by the Miniſters of the Goſpel. When the general promiſe of ſalvation is particularly manifeſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and the tenders of life and happineſs are made to our ſouls, by the Embaſſadors whom Chriſt employeth to that end. This is the great priviledge of ſuch as have their ſtanding in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. As there is eternal life procured through the blood of the Lord Jeſus, ſo it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. Chriſt doth beſeech them by his Miniſters to accept of it. The general promiſe of bleſſedneſs to all that believe, is brought home to them, and perſonally applyed unto them. This I call a <hi>doctrinal Application.</hi> Thus <hi>Peter</hi> applyed the grace of God unto the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64514:72"/>ſhall come at the day of judgment, which will be a day of gladneſs and refreſhment to believers, then you ſhall be openly acquitted from your guilt; it ſhall be proclaimed in the face of all the world that you are pardoned and accepted. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> apply ſalvation to the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſe.</hi> There is an univerſal promiſe, that whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved: Now ſay <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to the keeper of the priſon, Thou art not excluded out of this promiſe: by vertue of our commiſſion from Chriſt, and in his name, we tender ſalvation to thee, and to thine houſe. This application doth oftentimes leave men as it found them; life and happineſs is tendered, and they put it far from them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an internal, but conditional applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the benefits of redemption: and this is wrought by the Spirit of God dealing with a mans ſpirit. When the holy Ghoſt doth preſent unto the ſoul, what in the Miniſtery of the Word was ſounded in the ear.

This is ſometimes called a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door of the ſoul, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him and he with me.</hi> By the door underſtand the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64514:72"/>heart of a ſinner, whereby entrance is made into the whole perſon, and poſſeſſion took; as a man entreth into an houſe by the door: <hi>the heart,</hi> which is naturally ſhut againſt Chriſt, nay barred and bolted againſt him, by vain thoughts, and vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and carnal reaſonings; by pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and love of ſin and the world: Now to this door Chriſt cometh by the Spirit, who acteth in his name, and <hi>knocketh at the door,</hi> that is, he doth argue and reaſon the caſe with mens ſouls, by his internal motions; that they would accept of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as it is offered. He doth expoſtulate with them, why they will be ſo fooliſh as to ſpend their time and ſtrength in ſeeking after that which is not bread, and cannot ſatisfie? And in order to move them to turn to God, he doth ſet ſalvation before them, and aſſureth them of the enjoyment of it, if they will ſubmit to the government of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>If any man open the door I will come in unto him, &amp;c.</hi> This I call an internal-conditional appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe it is an inward work of the Spirit, treating with the heart of a ſinner. And pray mind it <hi>Sirs,</hi> as it is a common thing, ſo it is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to ſtand out againſt this application of eternal life. When the holy Ghoſt hath been dealing with a mans heart, convincing him of the neceſſity of cloſing with Chriſt, and he doth break through ſuch convictions, God doth many times withdraw the very ſtrivings of his ſpirit from ſuch a ſinner, and never dealeth with him further in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his converſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my reproof, behold I will pour out my ſpirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</hi> It is the ſpeech of Chriſt the eternal Wiſdom of God inviting ſinners to repentance; <hi>q.d.</hi> I do not only call upon you
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64514:73"/>by my Word, but I will ſend the holy Ghoſt to treat with you: He ſhall ſpeak over to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences what the Miniſter preacheth in your ears. And what is the iſſue of rejecting this work of the holy Ghoſt? See v. 24. and onward. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed: I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded: But ye have ſet at nought all my counſels, and would none of my reproof: I alſo well laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. When your fear cometh as deſolation, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh as a whirlwind.</hi> [That is, when judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you were afraid of ſhall actually ſeize upon you, and make you deſolate: when the wrath of God ſhall fall down upon you ſuddenly, in a dreadful and terrible manner.] <hi>When diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you: Then ſhall they call upon me but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me.</hi> How is this to be underſtood, ſeeing God is alwayes found of ſuch as ſeek him in ſincerity? Why the meaning ſeemeth to be this, God will withdraw his ſpirit, and deal with their hearts no further, and then they will grow hard and impenitent: and though they cry in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet it will only be the cry of hypocrities; ſuch as the Lord will have no manner of regard unto. <hi>O my brethren,</hi> let this dreadful Scripture, and theſe awakening expreſſions, ſink deep into your ears; that you may not dare to reſiſt the holy Ghoſt, or to ſend him grieved away from you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an effectual ſaving application of the benefits of redemption, when they are ſo apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us as to be made ours: ſo that we may ſay, this promiſe is a part of my heritage, and the other mercy is that which I have an intereſt in: And this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64514:73"/>is effected upon our union with Chriſt. When the holy Ghoſt doth not only ſhew us his excellency, and propound unto us ſalvation through his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; but doth alſo mightily prevail upon us to come unto Chriſt, and we get into him; then we have a right to all that he hath to beſtow upon the ſons and daughters of men. Firſt we muſt have the Son, and ſo a right to the inheritance by the Son, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Mark it, Then he is made ſo to us, when we are in him. It is one thing for Chriſt to be made wiſdom, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> to be ſet apart as the ſtore-houſe of all theſe ſpiritual good things: and it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing for him to be made ſo <hi>to us.</hi> By vertue of God's commiſſion, and the qualifications pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon the Lord Jeſus, and that active and paſſive obedience undertaken and performed by him, he is made wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and fanctification, and redemption: he is delegated to be God's high-ſteward or Treaſurer for the giving out of theſe mercies: he is become the ſource and fountain of all ſaving grace. But when we are in him, he is made <hi>wiſdom to us,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs to us,</hi> and <hi>ſanctification to us,</hi> and <hi>redemption to us:</hi> ſo that we are actually made partakers of them. Theſe four things ſeem to comprehend the whole of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions made to conduct a ſinner to glory. 1. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the revelation of the mind of God to us. 2. Righteouſneſs, for our acceptation with the Lord. 3. Sanctification, for inabling us to walk as a peculiar people, and for carrying on the work of holineſs to perfection. 4. Redemption, for our full deliverance from miſery, and compleating our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64514:74"/>happineſs. And all theſe are made over to us, by vertue of our union with him, our myſtical one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ,</hi> I ſhall return anſwer to this queſtion, by laying down and enlarging upon eight diſtinct and gradual Propoſitions. To which I muſt intreat your heedful and diligent attendance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1. The firſt Propoſition is this, That all the children of men in their unregeneracy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are partakers of the differencing or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace of God, are wholly ſeparated from Chriſt, and meer ſtrangers unto him. As they are afar off from God, by reaſon of their apoſtacy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion from: ſo they are without Chriſt, by whom alone they can be brought back again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64514:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lord. They can plead no ſhare in his death and ſufferings, or if they do plead it, they will be found guilty of uſurpation: for they are without him in the world. This is clearly the doctrine of the Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>At that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being aliens from the commonwealth of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe.</hi> At that time] that is, whilſt you were dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, before you were quickned by grace accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the riches of the mercy and love of God, <hi>v.</hi> 4,5. then ye were <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> not only deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the knowledge of Chriſt as Gentiles (though that ſeems to be the primary intent of the words) but without an intereſt in him becauſe unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners. For what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Gentiles is true, in that ſenſe, of all wicked ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons whomſoever. There is no difference in that reſpect between. Jews and Heathens; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſors, and open Infidels. S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly doth include himſelf, and ſuch as he was before his converſion. And therefore in the day of grace, when the eternal love of God doth break forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his choſen people, they are ſaid to be brought to Chriſt, and eſpouſed unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. When they are taught of God, they are drawn to the Son of God: when they have heard and learnt of the Father, then they come unto Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. evidently implying, that before they had ſo learned, they were without Chriſt; and at a diſtance from him. That is the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2. The ſons and daughters of men in their carnal unconverted eſtate, over and above their diſtance and ſeparation from Chriſt, are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64514:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>knit and joyned unto ſuch objects, as are wholly inconſiſtent with their Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I will inſtance eſpecially in two things. They are
<list>
                     <item>1. In Covenant with ſin.</item>
                     <item>2. Contracted to the Law.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They are in covenant with ſin, and at league of peace with their corruptions: their ſpirits are glewed and faſtened unto baſe luſts and pollutions. Though ſome remainders of ſin abide in the hearts of the godly, whilſt on this ſide of heaven, yet they are hated and abhorred, they are ever purſuing them unto death, and executing a kind of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon them, and never ſatisfied till they are utterly vanquiſhed and rooted up: But now an unregenerate perſon is under the dominion of ſin, as an hired ſervant is under the command of his maſter; Pride bids him go, and he goeth; flattery biddeth him run, and he runneth; covetouſneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth him to do this, and he doth it: carnal fear requireth him to wound his conſcience in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and he woundeth it; uncleanneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him to venture upon that provocation of the wrath of God, and he ventureth: as having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up himſelf to the obedience of ſin. As the Lord ſaith of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, it is true, in its kind and meaſure, of all impenitent ſinners; <hi>They are joyned to their idols, Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. Sin hath a being and reſidence in the hearts of the deareſt of God's ſervants, but the ſpirits of the wicked are faſt link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with it. Such a one as <hi>Paul</hi> may be ſold under ſin, but <hi>Ahab</hi> ſells himſelf to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.20. Unconverted ſinners yield up themſelves

You ſhall find that ſin is as dear to a natural man, as the moſt uſeful members of the body: Hence it is that Chriſt compareth a mans beloved luſts to the right hand, and the right eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is that their hearts are ſo ready to riſe up with indignation, and hatred againſt the means, which are made uſe of to rid them of their ſins: and that ſometimes they will not ſtick to be at a great deal of coſt, and pains to retain their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.

Into a polluted ſoul Chriſt the wiſdom of God will not enter, nor will he take up his habitation with thoſe that are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with ſin. That's the firſt object to which ſinners are joyned in oppoſition unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are contracted unto the Law, as it is a covenant of life; and are ready to ſeek for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and acceptance upon legal terms; which is a ſtrong bar in the way of union with Chriſt. For where the Lord Jeſus is a Saviour indeed, he will be acknowledged as a perfect Saviour, he will have the whole glory of our redemption redound unto himſelf. See what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Gal. 5.4. <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law;</hi> that is, if you ſeek to be juſtified by it; none are or can be juſtified by it in reality, but if you rely thereupon, and expect and look for acceptation with God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe terms, you will undoubtedly fall ſhort of the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: you do quite put your ſelves from under his ſhadow. If you reſt upon the works of the Law, never think to receive benefit by the death of the Mediator of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of peace and reconciliation: Chriſt is become of none effect unto you. Now <hi>Sirs,</hi> juſtification by works is mans natural element, upon which his ſoul is fixed, and where he delights to dwell. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Law is diſabled to miniſter relief unto fallen ſinners, yet there is a proneſs in them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64514:76"/>after it ſtill, and to reſt their ſouls upon that foundation. This is plain from the pains the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taketh in his Epiſtles to unſettle men from this bottom, to take them off from leaning upon this broken reed: eſpecially in his Epiſtles to <hi>Rom.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> Beſides, you read expreſly of mens deſires to be under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Tell me, ye that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be under the Law,</hi> q. d. I perceive that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your ſpirits have a tendency, there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination in you to ſplit your ſelves upon this rock; as there is in a ſtone to deſeend downwards, towards its center. As the Law is <hi>a rule of life,</hi> ſo it is written upon the heart of a Believer: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons cleave to it as it is <hi>a covenant of works:</hi> they make uſe of it ſo, as to ſeek juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thence. And this moſtly ariſeth from that monſtrous pride, which is faſt rooted and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in mens hearts: they would fain advance ſomething of themſelves, and are loath to give the glory of their ſalvation to another. It is an harder thing to cloſe with the grace of God, and to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie free grace in ſalvation, than moſt perſons ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. This is the ſecond Propoſition. That uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinners are not only ſeparated from Chriſt, but actually joyned unto ſuch objects as are utterly incompatible with their being in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 3. Hence it clearly followeth as a third Propoſition, That the firſt work which is wrought upon the ſpirit of a man, in order to his conjunction and oneneſs with the Lord Jeſus, it is the ſeparation or withdrawment of his ſoul from theſe objects, unto which he is joyned in oppoſition unto Chriſt. Till this work be done, the finner is not in a neer capacity of having the Son of God, of being joyned to the Redeemer. Firſt, a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64514:77"/>muſt be written, and the former hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands put away, before the ſoul can be married to another husband; to him that is raiſed from the dead. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> Chriſt will not be a ſharer with another: if he have the ſoul <hi>at all,</hi> he will have it <hi>altogether:</hi> if perſons have the Son <hi>really,</hi> they muſt have him <hi>only.</hi> So that firſt the ſoul muſt be wrought upon to renounce thoſe things which ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the Lord Jeſus, that they may be in a preparedneſs to be knit unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10, 11. <hi>Hearken O daughter, and conſider, and incline thine car: forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe: ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty.</hi> They are words ſpoken of the myſtical marriage betwixt Chriſt and his Church

See the proof of each.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64514:77"/>1. He muſt be dead to ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi>

He muſt be dead to the Law: becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a man to be coupled to both together. It was a defectiveneſs herein which was the cauſe of the utter undoing of the carnal <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> they were faſt joyned unto the Law, and they could not be taken off from ſeeking life upon thoſe terms; and therefore, though they followed after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, yet they did not attain it, they fell ſhort of righteouſneſs. How came it to paſs, that they fell ſhort of what they ſought after? Why, <hi>Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32. That's the third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The firſt work that is wrought upon the ſpirit of a man, in a tendency to his conjunction and oneneſs with Chriſt, is the ſeparation of his ſoul from ſin, and the Law; to which he is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally joyned in oppoſition to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 4. The divorce and ſeparation of a ſinner from his iniquity, which is of indiſpenſable neceſſity to the reception of Chriſt, and union with him, is principally accompliſhed by a fourfold act. 1. The eyes of the underſtanding are opened, to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64514:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſee the evil of ſin. 2. The heart is awakened, to conſider the conſequents of that evil. 3. The ſpirit is made to tremble, in apprehenſion of the danger of continuing in ſin. 4. The grace of mortification is poured out, for the ſubduing of corruption, and a ſecret antipathy put into the ſoul againſt it. When this work is wrought, then the ſinner is ſet free from bondage unto his luſts, and is at liberty to be married to another. I will briefly touch upon theſe four ſteps, or acts of the holy Ghoſt, whereby tho divorce is made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an act of <hi>Conviction,</hi> whereby the eyes of the underſtanding are enlightened, to ſee the evil of ſin: and that with application to a mans ſelf, and his own tranſgreſſions and iniquities. For indeed general notions of the evil of ſin, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a due operation upon the heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<note n="*" place="margin">Generalia non pungunt.</note>, unleſs it be brought home, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation to a mans ſelf. When a ſinner is wrought upon ſo as to turn ſavingly from his iniquities, he is made to do it underſtandingly: God working upon a mans heart, anſwerably to mans nature. He doth not force him to caſt off his ſins againſt his will, but maketh him ready and willing to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them: and to that purpoſe, he giveth the ſinner a ſight of the guilt he is under. He maketh him to know what a contempt ſin is of the Majeſty of heaven, what a ſlighting of an holy, and juſt, and righteous Law; what a deſpiſing of the goodneſs and compaſſion of the Lord, and conſequently a provocation of his wrath: that ſo there may be raiſed in the ſoul a regular abhorrence of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt it: and the ſinner may be willing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64514:78"/>to ſue out a divorce. Will the perſon think, when he is throughly convinced of ſin, What a fool was I thus to ſerve theſe baſe luſts and pleaſures? What madneſs poſſeſſed me, that I ſhould depart from the Lord and follow after lying vanities? For mark it <hi>Sirs,</hi> When the affections act <hi>regularly,</hi> in cloſing with, or rejecting and refuſing any ſpiritual object, there muſt alwayes precede a competent knowledge of the good or evil of that object. And the reaſon is plain, becauſe the will and affections are blind and dependent faculties, they depend in their operations, upon the information of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. So that the heart cannot hate the evil of ſin, nor will the perſon loath himſelf upon the account of it, till the judgment be convinced of the nature and greatneſs of that evil. You read of this as one of the firſt works of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. <hi>When the comforter is come, he will convince the world of ſin.</hi> He will make them to ſee clearly what an ugly deformed nature it is of, what a bitter thing it is to rebel againſt the moſt high. He will diſcover unto them the guilt which lieth upon their ſouls; and that by ſuch evident concluding argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as will take away from them all excuſes whatſoever, whereby they were apt to cover their tranſgreſſions:
<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> and therefore it followeth, that he will convince them of their unbelief, which is the great damning ſin, and that whereby other tranſgreſſions are faſt bound upon the ſoul. To this end God doth ſometimes bring the ſinner into ſore afflictions and tribulations; that he may thereby taſte the bitterneſs and malignity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from him: which before was accounted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64514:79"/>but a trivial matter, little to be regarded, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, 10. <hi>When they be bound in fetters, and holden in the cords of affliction, then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſions that they have exceeded. He openeth their ear alſo to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19.</note> To this purpoſe, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth ſet the Law before a mans face, in the ſpiritualneſs, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and excellency of it; that the ſinner may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelf in that glaſs, and paſs judgment upon the evils of his heart and wayes, according to that rule. For <hi>when the commandment cometh, then ſin will revive indeed,</hi> and be ſeen in its proper colours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. Before, the perſon is miſtaken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil of it, he reckoneth it a ſmall matter, and wondereth that Miniſters and Preciſians ſhould make ſuch an ado againſt ſin; becauſe he judgeth of it by falſe rules: by the opinion which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the world have concerning it; by the pleaſure and worldly advantage that are attendant upon it, and the like: But <hi>when the Law cometh</hi> his miſtakes are rectified, and he ſeeth ſin as it is. And to this end the Spirit of God doth make diſcoveries unto the ſoul of the holineſs, and purity, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and ſpotleſs perfections of the nature of God himſelf, againſt whom ſin is committed. <hi>When Job ſaw the Lord, then he did abhor himſelf, as in duſt and aſhes, Job</hi> 42.4, 5. When <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had a full ſight of the infinite power, and holineſs, and glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, then he cried out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips, Iſa.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. This is a certain rule, and if you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your hearts anddemeanour, the truth of it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64514:79"/>will every day further appear to you by experience That as your <hi>apprehenſions of God are,</hi> ſo the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your <hi>applications unto God</hi> will be, and ſo your <hi>apprehenſions of the evil of ſin</hi> againſt God will be likewiſe. This is the firſt act in order unto a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from ſin, An act of Conviction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an act of <hi>Conſideration,</hi> wherein the heart is awakened to weigh the ſad conſequents of the evil of ſin: What will be the iſſue of theſe things? What will become of my precious and immortal ſoul, if I go on in this courſe? There is no way (thinketh the ſinner) to eſcape the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hell, without converſion: and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof will be endleſs and everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If I am once caſt into that lake, there is no deliverance out of it. Therefore you read of confidering and turning from ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27, 28. <hi>When the wicked turneth from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive: Becauſe he conſidereth, and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> And the truth is, the reaſon why men and women do ſtill hug their ſins in their boſoms, and roll them as a ſweet morſel under their tongues, is for want of conſideration. If they did ſit down and conſult what would become of them: did they lay it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to heart, and revolve it in their thoughts, what precious ſouls their luſts are deſtroying, what inſupportable wrath they are pulling down upon their heads, what rich grace they are abuſing, what an incomprehenſible Majeſty they are ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and what a diſmal condition it will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpeedy repentance, reduce them unto; would they harbour ſin any longer in their hearts? would
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64514:80"/>they not flie from it as from a Serpent? certainly they would caſt it away with indignation, and ſay, Get ye hence ye filthy accurſed luſts, you have brought me into a wretched eſtate, and ſhould I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you ſtill, I muſt be undone forever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.7. <hi>Thou didſt not lay theſe things to thine heart, neither didſt thou remember the latter end of it.</hi> As if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt had ſaid, the cauſe of your continuance in ſin is want of conſideration: if you had laid the end of it to heart, it would have put a ſtop to your carier in a courſe of impiety. This will appear in the return of the prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17, 18. <hi>When he came to himſelf, he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my fathers have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger?

Before that time he gave up himſelf in ſubjection to his luſts, and did not conſider what he was doing: he did not bethink himſelf, as the expreſſion is 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.47. <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves, and repent</hi> This is the ſecond act in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a divorce from ſin.

When God doth bleſs mens ſouls in turning them from their iniquities, he doth firſt cauſe them to grieve, and be in bitterneſs for thoſe iniquities, and ſtirreth up in them a dread and fear of his judgments.

A little ſerious ſtudy of it would ſoon diſpel thoſe miſts of ignorance. There is a threefold ignorance of the Law, which is the occaſion of mens reſting upon it for acceptance, and ſeeking juſtification thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ignorance of the terms of the Law, upon which life is promiſed therein, and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made over thereby: unacquaintedneſs with the conditions that are required, to put us under the verge and compaſs of juſtification by it. Men think to come up to the terms of the Law, becauſe they do not mind and conſider wherein thoſe terms do conſiſt, upon which it promiſeth juſtification: nor of what extent and latitude they are.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The hankering of a mans heart after juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Law, doth proceed from ignorance of the ſpiritualneſs of it. If it were ſtudied in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, it would ſufficiently manifeſt its own inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſave us: for the Law requireth holineſs in our perſons, as well as rectitude in our lives; it is the rule of mans nature, <hi>what he ſhould be,</hi> as well as the rule of his practiſe, <hi>what he ſhould do.</hi> The Law condemneth us for the native pravity and pollution of our hearts and ſpirits within us, and not only for the actual miſcarriages in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour: ſo that, which of the poſterity of fallen man can ſtand before it? The Law injoyneth an abſolute rectitude and purity in the thoughts, and affections, and firſt motions of the ſoul; as well as integrity in the outward carriage: ſo that, it is not a civil converſation which will bring you off from the curſe denounced by it. If you could ſuppoſe a man that had walked all his life-time blameleſs, that no man could charge him with guilt upon any account: that no one could ſay <hi>black was his eye</hi> (as the ſelf-juſticiaries boaſt is) yet the Law will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64514:83"/>him accurſed, and ſend him to hell, for the leaſt vain imagination: for the leaſt riſing of a proud thought, or an envious thought, or an unbelieving thought, or the like: for the ſmalleſt inordanateneſs in the affections: nay, for the corruption brought with us into the world, as well as for the groſſer pollutions perpetrated and committed in the world. And the reaſon is becauſe the Law is ſpiritual: it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broad, as the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfections, but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> It is as extenſive as the workings of the whole ſoul of a man, in any part or faculty of the ſame: it is as broad as the perſon; it reacheth to the nature, it is a diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of, and giveth preſcriptions unto the very thoughts and intents of the heart. Thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth vindicate it from the falſe gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſees, whereby they did narrow the commandment, and enervate the force of it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>Ye have heard it was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill, and whoſoever ſhall kill ſhall be indanger of the judgment. But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever is engry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judgment: and whoſoever ſhall ſay unto his brother,</hi> Racha, <hi>ſhall be in danger of the council: but whoſoever ſhall ſay,</hi> thou fool, <hi>ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell fire.</hi> It is as much as if our Saviour had ſaid, Your teachers of old in their interpretations of the Law confined the prohibition to the external act: but I tell you, the Law is ſpiritual, the leaſt ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs anger is murder in Gods account, and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wrath of God, as well as actual killing; if there be hatred of his brother in a mans heart, he is a murderer; much more if he expreſs that anger or hatred in any contemptuous and provokin,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64514:84"/>words. The like you have in the caſe of adultery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.27, 28. Now if this ſpiritualneſs of the Law were but throughly ſtudied, it would take off mens hearts from reſting thereupon. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth us for the firſt riſing, or ebullition of ſin within us, as well as for the groſs outward acts of impiety. It ſpeaketh a man accurſed for the defects and imperfections in his obedience, as well as for the neglect and omiſſion of his obedience. It leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him under the wrath of God, for the original corruption of his heart. For as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the Law: for I had not known luſt</hi> [or concupiſcence] <hi>except the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> And <hi>therefore by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his</hi> [Gods] <hi>ſight, for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin:</hi> as the argument is preſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third ground of a mans truſting in his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal righteouſneſs, is ignorance of the rigour and ſeverity of the Law. It requireth exact conformity the precepts thereof, but adminiſters no ſtrength or aſſiſtance to help us in the obſervation of thoſe precepts:
<note n="*" place="margin">Lex jubet, gratia juvat.</note> It calleth for exact performance of what is required, and leaveth no room for repentance &amp; pardon upon any failings whatſoever; nor doth it promiſe acceptance upon our repentance. The Law <hi>Sirs,</hi> or Covenant of works doth not know what a pardon meaneth. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon ſuppoſal of ſin it injoyneth repentance, but doth not accept repentance in any caſe. The Law is ſuch a ſevere task-maſter, that when it hath appointed our work there is no relaxation to be expected: it will not make any abatement in the leaſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64514:84"/>thoſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> Mark it, not he that repenteth for his neglect of what is not done, but <hi>he that doth them:</hi> not he that is humbled for his imperfections and failings, but who ſo never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the leaſt particular. And if this were well conſidered, the Law it ſelf would knock us off from dependance on the Law; and would thereby prove as a Schoolmaſter to drive us unto Chriſt. You have many carnal people, when conſcience galleth them for ſin, and their hearts ſmite them for their abominations, they will mourn and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a little under the ſenſe of it; they are filled with trouble, and perplexity, and a great deal of legal ſorrow upon that account, and here they take up their reſt. Surely, think they, God will pardon and accept of us, for we have grieved and repent of what we have done. Why mind it <hi>Sirs,</hi> As this doth proceed from ignorance of the nature of repentance [the repentance of <hi>Judas</hi> carried him thus far: True Evangelical repentance doth doth not only humble a man for ſin, but turneth him from it even unto God, and is mingled with faith in the blood of Chriſt] ſo it proceedeth from ignorance of the law. If thou art not in Chriſt, but ſtandeſt on the old bottom of legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is not one word in that Covenant for admiſſion of repentance: that is a priviledge brought to light by the Goſpel, a part of the purchaſe of the death of the Mediator of the Covenant of grace; who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and ſuch as are turned out of the way. The Covenant of works knoweth nothing of forgiveneſs of ſin upon our repentance: it ſpeaketh not a ſyllable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, unleſs we had kept undefiled in the way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt aberration, or wandring out of it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64514:85"/>Chriſt Jeſus is the Author of repentance, and of acceptance therein, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.30, 31. <hi>The God of our fathers raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew, and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt inſtrument that God maketh uſe of, to take off mens hearts from ſeeking juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the law, that they may be united unto Chriſt; <hi>viz. the Law it ſelf.</hi> And indeed it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to that end, not that perſons might reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but might ſee the utter impoſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved by it; that it may ſhew us the neceſſity of Chriſts righteouſneſs, and lead us unto him. It was publiſhed as a Covenant of works upon this very deſign, that it might lock men up under guilt, and bind them over to the wrath of God, and make them to ſee their miſerable and remedileſs condition in themſelves, that ſo they might be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to run for refuge unto Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>What things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law.</hi> To what end? Why, <hi>that every month may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> The end of the law] that is, ſay ſome, of all the ſhadows and ceremonies of the law, they had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Chriſt, and did typifie and prefigure the Lord Jeſus. I would not exclude this ſenſe, but I think it may be meant of the publication of the law as a Covenant; it was to this end, that ſinners might ſee more clearly into the weakneſs of the law to juſtifie them, and ſo might have recourſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto Chriſt, and be juſtified by faith. The law it ſelf doth bear teſtimony of itſelf, how unable it is,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64514:85"/>being become weak through the fleſh: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is the end of it, to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, ſuch a glorious righteouſneſs as abideth for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſpecial means to divorce men from the law, or to deaden them unto the law, that they may be married or united to the Son of God, <hi>is the body of Chriſt;</hi> the ſufferings of Chriſt in his body, the curſed death which he underwent for the ſake of ſinners. The death of Chriſt doth not enervate or exauctorate the law of God, <hi>as it is a commandment for guidance of our wayes,</hi> or as it is a rule of life:

But now, as it is a Covenant of life, and doth promiſe juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication unto the obſervers of it, ſo the death of Chriſt doth deaden us unto the law: it is of notable force and efficacy to take off a man from building
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64514:86"/>and bottoming upon his own legal performances. For this very <hi>topick</hi> the Apoſtle argueth with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> cap. 3.1. <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified among you?</hi> Mark it, the great matter wherein the <hi>Galatians</hi> fell from the truth of the Goſpel, was by adhaering to the law, and ſeeking righteouſneſs therein: Now ſaith the Apoſtle, a man would have thought, the doctrine of Chriſt's death and crucifixion might have been a ſtrong fence againſt that error, unleſs you had been under a kind of faſcination and witchcraft upon your ſpirits. Hath the great fundamental principle of the death of Chriſt, been ſo plainly and faithfully preached unto you, and ſet forth amongſt you in ſuch lively colours, as if he had been crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, and are you ſtill ſo fooliſh as to reſt upon the law? Certainly this is an argument of abundant ſottiſhneſs and madneſs, or elſe you have quite forgotten the doctrine of Chriſt's death, and neglect to make a due improvement thereof. The death of Chriſt will be of notable uſe to deaden a man to the law, by making a threefold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By diſcovering the ſinfulneſs and damnable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the evil of ſin, or tranſgreſſionof the law of God: in that it could be expiated at no leſſer rate, than by the crucifying of the Son of God. It is not any corruptible thing, as ſilver and gold, could make ſatisfaction for ſin, <hi>but the precious blood of the Son of God;</hi> and therefore certainly it is an evil of a very heinous nature. Thus, my brethren, a real ſight of the greatneſs of the evil of ſin, would ſooner convince a man of the inſufficiency of all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64514:86"/>his legal righteouſneſs, to ſatisfie for the wrong that is done unto God by it. If men think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the Lord, by any obedience of their own, for the ſins whereof they are guilty, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have low and ſlight thoughts of the evil of their ſins. Now the death of Chriſt may ſerve to rectifie ſuch thoughts, and to ſet forth the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of the nature of ſin. And indeed it was one of the ends which God aimed at in the death of Chriſt; as to ſave the ſinners, ſo to damn the ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh; God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin, condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> He condemned it] <hi>that is,</hi> he made it thereby to appear what a deadly, deſtructive, and damnable nature it is of; how odious, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a thing it is in his ſight.
<note n="*" place="margin">He condemned it of that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital crime, that it was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of the death of Chriſt, who was moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. <hi>Engl. Annot.</hi>
                  </note> By what way was this made to appear? Why, becauſe nothing could appeaſe his wrath, but the crucifying of the Lord Jeſus. Undoubtedly it muſt needs be a very accurſed thing, for which Chriſt himſelf was made a curſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The death of Chriſt is of uſe to deaden a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the law, by making diſcovery of the inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of the juſtice of God: of his ſeverity and ſtrictneſs in requiring the utmoſt farthing, that is due for ſatisfaction. He did not ſpare his own Son, when he had iniquity laid upon him, but he was put to a painful, curſed, ignominious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful death; ſo that let not the children of men ever expect to be ſpared, if they lie under the guilt of the leaſt ungodlineſs. God the Father did
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64514:87"/>not abate his own beloved Son any part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; ſurely he will never make abatement unto his adverſaries. And this was another end of Chriſt's death, to ſet forth the exactneſs and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orableneſs of the juſtice of God; that he will by no means clear the guilty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God.

               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, the death of Chriſt will ſerve to take off a man from ſeeking juſtification by the law, by making a full diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that there is no other way imaginable to make reconciliation for ſin, and to deliver ſinners from the wrath to come; but the death of Chriſt only.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Sirs,</hi> if there had been any other way could have been found out, undoubtedly God would have ſpared the dearly beloved of his ſoul: he would never have ſtriken and bruiſed his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son. For as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>If there had been a law given which could have given life, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law, Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>q. d.</hi> Had that way been ſufficient, to ſave men and women from everlaſting deſtruction; God would have taken that way, and prevented the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and ſufferings of his Son. He would never have ſent him into the world, in ſuch a low and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64514:87"/>deſpicable condition: nor have brought him into ſuch ſtrairs and agonies, as made him ſweat drops of blood: not would he have poured out upon him the vials of his wrath, for the accompliſhment of that which might have been otherwiſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. So that to teſt for juſtification upon the law is, in effect, to fruſtrate and make void the grace of God, in the death of the Mediator: <hi>For if righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain, Gal.</hi> 2.21.

The Lord Chriſt, by his Spirit, taketh poſſeſſion of them, and dwelleth in them; and Believers through faith of the operation of the Spirit, take hold of Chriſt, and get into him; and ſo they are knit together and become one.

The bond, on Chriſt's part, is <hi>the Spirit,</hi> whereby the people of God are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, and he taketh up his abode in them. For he dwelleth in them by his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10. <hi>But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

The bond of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the Believers part, is <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby they do apprehend the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and take him home, as it were, unto themſelves. Being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by him, they take hold of him; and ſo they are knit together, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> Firſt Chriſt cometh by the holy Ghoſt and entereth into them, and then they are inabled by faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him unto themſelves, and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto him: and ſo they are conjoyned, and made one together.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64514:89"/>ſuch as upon trial are found to deal falſely, and unfaithfully in the Covenant of God: except you are rotten at the heart, gilded metal, that will not abide the teſt and touchſtone, you muſt have Chriſt within you. It is not enough that Chriſt be preached unto you, but he muſt be revealed in you. As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of his converſion and miſſion to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. <hi>When it pleaſed God who ſpearated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me.</hi> Not only called me to be an Apoſtle, and made known Chriſt unto me; but alſo called me to the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, revealing him in me. The bond of this Union is the Spirit of Chriſt, which is ſhed abroad in to the hearts of God's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people; and whereby the Lord Jeſus taketh up his habitation in them. For it is the Spirit that treateth with them in Chriſt's name, and takes poſſeſſion of them to his uſe and ſervice. For <hi>hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which be hath given us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. This is the firſt ſort of Union betwixt Chriſt and Believers, which we call a natural union: and it is wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt that dwelleth in them. Concerning which, I will enlarge a little, for the better clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to your underſtandings, under five Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This dwelling of Chriſt in the ſouls of his people by his Spirit, whereupon doth ariſe a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral union with him, is the ſame thing, <hi>for ſubſtance</hi> with the poſitive part of the grace of regeneration: whereby the principles of holineſs and new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are introduced into them; and the image of God is reſtored upon their natures. For it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the holy Ghoſt maketh his entrance into
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64514:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>them, and fixeth his ſettlement with him. <hi>You know</hi> that regeneration or ſanctification (take it for the firſt ſaving change, or diſtinguiſhing work, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul) conſiſteth of two parts. 1. There is a privative part, or the mortification and ſubduing the principles and habits of ſin. 2. There is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part, or the introduction of new principles of grace, and holineſs. There is, 1. A blotting out the image of the devil. 2. Stamping upon a mans heart the divine nature again. You read of them diſtinctly, <hi>A taking away the heart of a ſtone, and giving an heart of fleſh, Ezek.</hi> 11.19. There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the old man, and a bringing in of the new man, which is created after God. Now Chriſt's being in his people by his Spirit, is the ſame thing, for <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> with this poſitive part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. By the mortification of ſin, Satan is outed of his poſſeſſion of the ſoul: and by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of ſpiritual grace Chriſt enters, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth poſſeſſion of the ſoul; by the renewing of the holy Ghoſt. Thus you have it explained (for one expreſſion there ſeemeth to be exegetical of the other) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you. And I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh: and I will put my Spirit within you.</hi> Mark it, by the renovation of the heart God's Spirit is ſaid to be within us. And by the waſhing of regeneration the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to be ſhed upon us abundantly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. In the new birth Chriſt is formed in the ſoul, by the working of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where Chriſt doth come, by the operations of his Spirit, to dwell in the hearts of his people, he doth at the ſame time make his entrance in their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64514:90"/>whole perſons; and take ſeizin and poſſeſſion of all their powers and faculties unto his uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The plian meaning is this; that the work of ſanctification is a <hi>through-work,</hi> wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole man: there is grace infuſed into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part and faculty. As in the work of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the habits of corruption are ſubdued; ſo in the work of renovation or vivification, all the ſeeds of holineſs are introduced: the whole man is purified as Chriſt is pure. The common gifts of the Spirit are beſtowed many times ſingly, and apart one from the other: but ſpecial ſanctifying graces are planted together. This I lay down, that you may not deceive yourſelves in this matter, by thinking Chriſt is in you, when you are ſtrangers unto him. There is great proneſs in us to miſtake upon this account; and to flatter our ſelves in this caſe: for ſome common workings upon the heart, to conclude that ſaving grace is planted in the heart. And therefore mind what I ſay, to prevent this ſelf-cozenage; that where a perſon is cleanſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and effectually, there is an univerſal puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the whole man; and all the graces, in the ſeed of them, are infuſed together. <hi>As all old things paſs away, ſo every thing is made new,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. The underſtanding is renewed with ſaving knowledge of the mind of God; and the will is brought into a bleſſed ſubjection to the will of God; the conſcience is furniſhed anew with tenderneſs and faithfulneſs: the affections are renewed by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned into their right channel, and pointed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their right objects: love and delight upon God, and hatred and ſorrow towards ſin; and what is diſpleaſing unto the Lord: the heart is principled anew, with ſincerity and ſingleneſs; and truth put
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64514:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>into the inward parts: the memory is made a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury and ſtore-houſe of good things; and the body is fitted to be ſubſervient unto the ſoul, in wayes of holineſs. Thus I might run over the ſeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this work. There is vigour and activity put into the ſoul, to do the will of God <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and patience to ſuffer, and be contented under the will of God <hi>diſpoſing:</hi> there is the grace of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to guide in <hi>proſperity;</hi> and the grace of faith, to ſupport under <hi>affliction</hi> and trouble: and the man is prepared and fitted unto every good word and work, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>And the very God of peace ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie you wholly; and I pray God, your whole ſoul, and ſpirit, and body be preſerved blameleſs, unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mark it <hi>Sirs,</hi> the work of ſanctification is a very extenſive and diffuſive work; it leaveneth the whole man, both the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and ſuperior faculties of the ſoul; the animal and the rational powers; and the body likewiſe. So that it is not ſome ſlight trouble upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for ſin, or a little touch upon the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or inclinations towards the Kingdom of God, that will evidence you to be ſanctified; for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ingageth the whole man in an holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the wayes of holineſs, and the intereſt of Jeſus. As a partial repentance, in the exerciſe of it, which ſtriketh at ſome ſins only, and leaveth a man in the allowance of others, is but a feigned repentance: ſo partial workings upon the heart, are but common workings; they will not amount to ſaving grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. When Chriſt entereth by his Spirit into any of the children of men, he doth take poſſeſſion of them wholly, and ſet up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in every part and faculty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this work of the entrance of the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64514:91"/>to a mans ſoul, whereupon Chriſt is ſaid to be in him, and to dwell with him, and poſſeſſion is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his uſe and ſervice; the ſoul of that man is altogether paſſive. My meaning is this, It is not in the power of any perſon upon the earth to plant grace in his own ſoul, or to confer the habits of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs upon himſelf: nor doth he contribute any active aſſiſtance in the performance of it; but is wholly wrought upon by the mighty power of God, and the effectual operation of the holy Ghoſt. We are apt to imagine, that it is in our own power to make a ſaving change within our ſelves: that we can convert and turn to God at any time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when we pleaſe. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid (in point of merit) there is a <hi>Pope</hi> in every mans belly: ſo may I ſay in this caſe, there is a tang of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> in every mans heart: and hence it is they take incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to procraſtinate, and delay, in the matters of ſalvation, they think they can repent when they will; if it be but upon their death-bed. But <hi>Sirs,</hi> it muſt be a day of power that maketh you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: A as, if God ſhould give you up unto your ſelves, you would periſh for ever in your unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. The planting grace in the heart is a turning the courſe of corrupted nature; it is as a quickning the dead: it is a creating and infuſing of how principles into a man;

               <p n="4">4.

But <hi>Sirs,</hi> this is to pervert the grace of the covenant; God forbid, there ſhould be ſuch curſed inferences drawn from this excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: although it tendeth to advance and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the free grace and power of God, yet it gives no manner of incouragement to the ſloth and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsne's of men. For though we are not active in the planting grace into our ſouls, yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expected at our hands, in order to the a tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. Although we cannot convert our ſelves, yet we are to wait upon God, that we may be converted by him: and are to attend upon the means which he hath appointed; and wherein he is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64514:92"/>wont, to meet the ſouls that ſeek him. Although we cannot cleanſe and ſanctifie our own ſpirits, yet we are diligently to ſearch the Scriptures, and to preſs arguments upon our ſelves from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and to give conſtant attendance upon God in his Ordinances, which are the ſpecial inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he is wont to make uſe of, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the ſpirit of ſanctification.

Why thou ſinful wretch, who thus cavilleſt againſt the Lord, haſt thou duly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſet upon the diſcharge of that work, which God calleth for in order to converſion? That is a notable acknowledgment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>We made not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquity, and underſtand thy truth.</hi> If <hi>Daniel</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:64514:93"/>had onely confeſſed that they had not turned from iniquity, might ſome captious ſinner have been apt to ſay, alas we had no power, we were not able to turn of our ſelves; yea, but ſaith that holy man, we have neglected the means which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to turn us; ſo put it home to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, haſt thou not reſiſted the Spirit whereby God hath many times ſtriven with thee? Haſt thou not neglected to ſtudy the word, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained prayer before the Lord, wherein perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he might have been found by thee?

               <p n="5">5. Theſe principles of grace infuſed into the ſoul, in the work of Regeneration; or this image of God reſtored upon the ſoul by the Spirit, in the day of converſion, may be called <hi>Chriſt in us;</hi> and the Lord Jeſus may be ſaid thereby to dwell with us; and that upon a fourfold account eſpecially. Becauſe

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be called <hi>Chriſt in us,</hi> becauſe the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of grace infuſed into the ſoul are derived upon us out of Chriſts fulneſs. The whole ſtock of grace was put into the hands of the Mediator, and from thence it is communicated unto Gods choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the Lord Jeſus was anointed with the Spirit without meaſure, it was put into his hands as into a common Store-houſe, or Magazine, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64514:93"/>from thence the Elect of God might be furniſhed. It was put into him as into a fountain, that out of that fountain our veſſels might be filled. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.19. And <hi>out of his fulneſs we all receive, and that grace for grace, John</hi> 1.16. And therefore it is called, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.2. It is in him originally, in us derivatively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imparted to us from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby <hi>Chriſt may be ſaid to dwell in us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe grace doth render a man conformable to Chriſt. In the work of Regeneration our natures are faſhioned according to his nature. As there is an anſwerableneſs between a Copy and the Orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from whence it is tranſcribed; there is line for line, and ſentence for ſentence, word for word, and letter for letter: ſo take the humane nature of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as he was anointed by the Holy Ghoſt, and the nature of a Perſon ſanctified; and there is a ſuitableneſs between them: there is love for love, and joy for joy, and hatred for hatred; they have the minde of Chriſt, and the meekneſs of Chriſt, and the long-ſuffering, and compaſſion, and gentleneſs of Chriſt, and the like. Therefore they are ſaid to purifie themſelves as he is pure, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the grace of Regeneration, <hi>the Lord Chriſt is ſaid to take up his abode in us,</hi> becauſe the Holy Ghoſt in that work doth act in his name: as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, and receiving commiſſion from him, and being ſent by vertue of his Prayer and Interceſſion, <hi>John</hi> 16.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive.</hi> In the tranſactions of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64514:94"/>everlaſting Covenant, our Lord Jeſus undertook to ſanctifie, and comfort, and to quicken and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his people; and by the Spirit of truth he doth accompliſh that undertaking. By his death the Spirit was purchaſed, and in his name he is ſent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grace of Regeneration may be ſtiled <hi>Chriſt dwelling in us,</hi> from the tendency of it; which is to bring ſinners in ſubjection to the Government of Chriſt, and to make them ready to obey the Laws of Chriſt. Hereby we become his Servants, and poſſeſſion is taken of us to his uſe and behoof: that we may cleave unto him, and be followers of him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.24. <hi>For ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 19.28. <hi>Ye that have followed me in the Regeneration, &amp;c.</hi> that is, in your regenerate condition, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that grace, which was beſtowed upon you in your New-birth; for ſo it may be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The grace of Regeneration plucketh ſinners out of the Kingdom of Satan, and ſeizeth on them for the ſervice of Chriſt, carryeth us out to him, and maketh us obedient to his Laws and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This may ſuffice to be ſpoken <hi>to the firſt branch of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which is between Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi> or the firſt ſort of Conjunction betwixt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>legal Conjunction</hi> and oneneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariſing from a Believers reception of Chriſt, cloſing with him, and getting into him. Such an Union as there is between the principal <hi>Debtor</hi> and the <hi>Surety,</hi> who hath paid the debt for him, and made over that payment unto him. The Law reckoneth them as one: what payment the Surety hath made for the Debtor in his name, and firmly made over unto him, the Law accounts it as if the Debtor himſelf had paid it; and diſchargeth him
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64514:94"/>thereupon, as if it had been his own perſonal Act and Deed: becauſe of that intimate relation, or oneneſs, that is betwixt them <hi>in the eſtimation of the Law.</hi> Such an union there is between Chriſt and his people; and therefore we call it a <hi>legal union,</hi> becauſe it hath a ſpecial reference unto the Law of God, which acquitteth the perſon thus united to Chriſt, by vertue of the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt; as fully and firmly, as if the party himſelf had ſuffered and ſatisfied. And likewiſe we call it a <hi>legal union,</hi> becauſe of the analogy it beareth unto the proceedings of Law in Courts of Judicature amongſt men. The bond of this union is a ſaving faith, whereby Believers receive Chriſt, and take hold on him. As by the Spirit of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration Chriſt doth take hold of their ſouls; ſo by a living faith of the operation of the Spirit, they are inabled to take hold of the Lord Jeſus: and ſo they are compacted and knit together. You know faith is ſet forth by ſuch expreſſions, a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>taking hold of him,</hi> John 1.12. <hi>But to as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the ſons of God; even to them that believe on his name.</hi> Mark it, we receive Jeſus Chriſt, and take him home to our ſelves, by believing on the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. As under the Law, when a man <hi>q. d.</hi> ran for refuge and protection to the <hi>Altar,</hi> he was wont <hi>to lay hold upon the horns of the Altar:</hi> ſo by faith a ſinner betaketh himſelf for ſhelter and ſecurity unto Chriſt, and layeth hold upon Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>That we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">We who to flee from deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wrath, have taken our courſe towards <hi>Jeſus;</hi> in hope to get the Salvation offered to us in him. <hi>Dickſ. in loc.</hi>
                  </note> that is, upon Jeſus Chriſt the object of our hope, and confidence; who is ſet
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64514:95"/>before us in the Goſpel, as the perſon in whom we are to truſt; and upon whom to rely and place our hope. By faith we lay hold upon him: and by this laying hold on Chriſt a Believer is joyned unto Chriſt, and made one with him. By faith we are in him, and put on his righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> It is of God] he provided it for us: and it is made over to us, and becometh ours by faith in the Mediator. This is the <hi>Second Branch</hi> of the mutual conjunction between Chriſt and a Believer, and the union thereupon: the bond whereof is faith in Chriſt. Concerning which I will propoſe onely theſe four things to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious peruſal, and meditations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt in the writings of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, doth diſtinctly ſpeak of a fourfold faith.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>an Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures, and the matters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to be Divine Truths, and to have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64514:95"/>from God,
<note n="*" place="margin">This is by ſome called a <hi>dogmatical</hi> faith.</note> ſuch a faith the Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been in <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in reſpect to the writings of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.27. <hi>King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>believeſt thou the Prophets?

I am confident thou art perſwaded of the truth of thoſe things. <hi>Agrippa</hi> being a <hi>Jew,</hi> and always converſant in <hi>Judea,</hi> could not be ignorant of the Scriptures; and <hi>Paul</hi> takes it for granted, that he who owned their Original to be of God, and that in them was diſcovered nothing but the truths of God. <hi>I know that thou believeſt,</hi> I am well aſſured thou dareſt not deny their Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This we call an <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> becauſe it aſſenteth to the truth of the Hiſtory of the Bible, as it is a Narrative of things done, and containeth Predictions of things to be done: as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends matters of fact mentioned to be performed, Doctrines aſſerted, Propheſies and Promiſes to be fulfilled, and the like.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64514:96"/>the word of God. <hi>Why?</hi> Becauſe all their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were of that Religion, and they were bred and brought up in that way; ſuch Miniſters have told them ſo, and they ſee many wiſe men are of that minde.

That is the firſt thing I would commend unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> this Scripture diſtinction of the ſorts of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This juſtifying faith hath the Lord Jeſut Chriſt himſelf, for the ſpecial immediate object, with whom it cloſeth; and upon whom it is exerciſed.</hi> It is Chriſt himſelf who is primarily tendered in the offers of the Goſpel, and therefore true faith, <hi>of this fort,</hi> goeth forth unto him. The ſpecial conſideration under which a Believer goeth forth to Chriſt, in the actings of faith for juſtification, it is <hi>as dying and ſatisfying the juſtice of God:</hi> (and therefore uſually called <hi>faith in his blood</hi>) and the great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereupon a Believer is emboldened to act his faith, is the tender of the Goſpel, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereof: but it is Chriſt himſelf which is the ſpecial, immediate object, upon which faith as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying is acted, and with whom it cloſeth. The ſinner being incouraged <hi>by the promiſe,</hi> doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt <hi>in the promiſe.</hi> Hence it is commonly ſtiled <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>believing on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 20.21. <hi>I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>teſtifying both to the Jews and alſo the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Mark it, as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath God for its ultimate object, it is a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſin, and returning unto God; <hi>even unto him:</hi> ſo faith hath Chriſt for its ſpecial object. The great fundamental act of faith, whereupon fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64514:97"/>are juſtified, is converſant about Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>That they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified, by faith that is in me;</hi>

                  </gap>: by faith that is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, [<hi>upon Jeſus,</hi> for they are his words] It is by faith exerted and acted upon him, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins is conveyed: Unto that it ſeemeth to relate, and the other words to come in as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis; <hi>as if it had been,</hi> that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, by faith that is in me; and (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It hath ſometimes appeared as ſtrange to me, to meet with deſcriptions of the nature of <hi>juſtifying faith,</hi> without ſo much as the mention of Jeſus Chriſt, the object upon whom it is acted. See the proceſs of the workings of the heart of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in believing; and how he taught in the Churches of Chriſt. Firſt he was deadned as to expectation of life from the Law, the firſt Covenant: and then he addreſſeth himſelf for juſtification unto Chriſt, by believing on him, who is the only Mediator of the ſecond Covenant. That Text is very full, and worthy to be wrot on our hearts in letters of gold, and as with the pen of a diamond, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt; even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law: for by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ultimate or compleating act of this</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, <hi>whereby it becometh ſuch, is a fiducial reſting or relying upon Chriſt, for righteouſneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with the Lord:</hi> and for all the ſpiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that follow thereupon. That which I aim at is this; That juſtifying faith is not abſolved and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64514:98"/>compleated, by a bare aſſent of the underſtanding; but it doth evidently include an act of the heart. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.10. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart,</hi> Acts 8.37. And the ſpecial act of the heart is a <hi>reliance upon Chriſt:</hi> leaving a mans ſoul in his hands, upon the articles of the Covenant of grace: leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his merits for acceptance with God: receiving him as he is offered to ſinners in the Goſpel; and truſting in him, for acceptance and ſalvation. Thus we have it explained, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt. In whom alſo ye truſted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalvation: in whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe</hi> This is the faith both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentiles: We first believed,</hi> unto whom the word of ſalvation was firſt ſpoken; and <hi>afterwards ye alſo believed</hi> in Chriſt. What is this believing? <hi>Why,</hi> it is a truſting in Chriſt. Firſt the ſoul heareth the word of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promiſed in Chriſt, and aſſenteth to the truth of that word, and thereupon is perſwaded to make his actual application unto Chriſt, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him for ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way: when his wrath is kindled but a little; bleſſed are all they that put their trust in him: q. d.</hi> There is no way of avoiding deſtruction from Chriſt, but by believing in him, reſting upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are the bleſſed of the Lord that put their truſt in him.

The Lord Jeſus in the Goſpel is ſet forth as a propitiation; he was ſent to be the Redeemer of loſt ſinners: Now when a perſon being affected with his loſt eſtate, ſenſible of the wrath of God, and the inſupportableneſs of it, and labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of ſin, doth come unto Chriſt as ſuch, and make uſe of him to that end: <hi>namely</hi> to be <hi>his</hi> Redeemer, and doth reſt upon him to make atonement for his ſoul; this is to believe with a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt.</hi> It is a <hi>looking unto Chriſt</hi> alone, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64514:99"/>and deliverance upon his account.

When a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſtung in his conſcience with the <hi>fiery Serpent</hi> of the guilt of ſin, and being filled with dread in apprehenſion of the ſad conſequents of it, doth look up unto Chriſt, as held forth <hi>upon the pole</hi> of the Goſpel to be a Saviour, and doth reſt upon him; expecting redemption only through his blood; here are the workings of a juſtifying faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up:</hi> [by dying on the Croſs; <hi>or</hi> by the publication and tender of his death and righteouſneſs in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel] <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> This is the third particular which I intended to commend to you, for opening the nature of faith, which is the bond of our union with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Wherever, and in what ſoul ſoever, there is this</hi> fiducial reliance <hi>upon Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs, in a ſaving way; there is alſo, as a neceſſary companion thereof, an univerſal ſubjection to the will of Christ, and a ready ſubmiſſion to his government.</hi> This I add, in the laſt place, to prevent (if it be poſſible) the abuſe of this doctrine by carnal hearts; and to ſtop the mouth of thoſe clamours, which are raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome againſt it, and the aſperſions which they caſt upon this evangelical truth; as if it were not a doctrine according to godlineſs. Will ſuch be ready to ſay, This doctrine will imbolden ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their preſumption, and vain confidence. If to believe ſavingly on Chriſt, be to reſt on him for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64514:99"/>ſalvation, who will not think that be doth believe? What carnal wretch will not ſay, that he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Chriſt? But <hi>mind it Sirs,</hi> it is not a <hi>thinking or ſaying he doth rely upon Chriſt,</hi> will give a man an intereſt in him; but when he doth <hi>reſt upon him indeed,</hi> as he is propounded for a Saviour in the Goſpel. And ſuch a faith will purifie the heart, and cauſe the perſon believing to bring forth fruits of holineſs, in the converſation. Elſe it will be an evidence that he doth but pretend thereunto, and doth not reſt upon Chriſt in truth. For although it be not the <hi>work faith</hi> [or faith as it is a ſpiritual act and work] not the <hi>works of faith,</hi> that juſtifie a ſinner in the ſight of God: yet that faith which giveth him a title to the righteouſneſs of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; by whom alone he can be juſtified, muſt be an <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>working faith;</hi> ſuch as purgeth the conſcience from dead works, and bringeth the ſoul into ſubjection unto Chriſt's Laws, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. To this purpoſe the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> are obſervable, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.14. <hi>What doth it profit my brethren, if a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith ſave him?</hi> It is not ſaid, though he have faith and have not works; for where there is faith in the heart, there will be new obedience in the life: but if <hi>he ſay</hi> that he hath it, if he be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender to it; can ſuch a dead, lifeleſs, pretended faith ſave him? Chriſt is held forth in the Goſpel, not only as a Redeemer, but as a Lord and a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: and theſe are inſeparably connected and knit together. He that preſumeth to divide between what God hath joyned together; that will accept of Jeſus as a Saviour, but not as a Soveraign, doth not indeed receive the Chriſt of God, but an idol ſtamed by his own heart. Whom he doth ſave, he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64514:100"/>will rule and govern, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He became the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal ſalvation, unto all them that obeyed him.</hi> I ſhall not need to trouble you with <hi>controverſal points,</hi> as whether faith, <hi>quà</hi> juſtifying [under that very notion or conſideration] doth receive Chriſt as a Lord? This is acknowledged on both hands, that the faith which juſtifieth doth receive Chriſt in al his offices, as a Prophet to inſtruct and guide us in the ways of God; as a King, to exerciſe, rule, and dominion over us; and as a Prieſt, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For a dividing faith is a falſe hypocritical faith, to whom Chriſt giveth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, he giveth repentance alſo. <hi>He ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> So that if we receive him as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> we muſt have him as a <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> for he ſaveth by ſanctifying, and conducteth ſinners to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace, by guiding their feet in the ways of peace.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ended together, the <hi>myſtical union</hi> betwixt believers and the Lord Jeſus (which I mainly drove at, and intend, when I ſhall ſpeak of it afterwards as the foundation of our communion with Chriſt, and receivings from him:) as alſo the <hi>ſixth Propoſition</hi> laid down to open the manner of the Conjunction between Chriſt and his people, and their oneneſs thereupon.

His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. I charge you O ye Daughters of Jeruſalem, by the Roes, and by the Hinds of the field, that ye ſtir not up, nor awake my love till he pleaſe:</hi> as if the Church had ſaid, O take heed of diſpleaſing the Lord Jeſus; there is nothing will cut me ſo deeply to the heart, as if you deſpiſe him, and ſin againſt him.

The watchmen that go about the City found me, to whom I ſaid, ſaw ye him whom my ſoul loveth? It was but a little that I paſſed from them, but I found him whom my ſoul loveth, I held him and would not let him go, till I had brought him into my Mothers houſe, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me:</hi> as if the ſoul of a believer ſhould ſay, how much doth my Spirit long after Chriſt? My thoughts are not onely upon him by day, but my meditation is concerning him in the night ſeaſon. And if he doth hide his face, I have no reſt in my Spirit: I make uſe of all means to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64514:101"/>recover the light of his countenance; I pray, and ſeek, and cry, and watch. I converſe with this Chriſtian touching the way to Chriſt, and I go to that Miniſter, to direct me in following after him. I leave no ſtone unturned, no means unaſſayed: And if I get but a glimpſe of his favour, I think all my endeavours well beſtowed. O how welcome is he to my ſoul?

How careful am I to preſerve my fellowſhip with him, that no clouds for the future may interpoſe betwixt me and the beams of that Sun of righteouſneſs? I might dwell upon the paſſages of this nature in that book: I will but point you to them. See the Churches as earneſt pantings after Chriſt, as the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, <hi>cap.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4.

Do not wonder that my heart is ſo ſet upon him, for he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely. If you knew but Chriſt as well as I, it would inflame your hearts in deſires after him; it would even raviſh your Spirits in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his beauty.

               <p>So <hi>upon the other hand,</hi> for the affection of Chriſt to believers; he hath them graven upon the palms of his hands, upon the very Tables of his heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rocks, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs, let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely, q. d.</hi> Thou that art deſpiſed amongſt men, but highly regarded in my ſight preſerved by my power and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is ſtable as the rock, that can never be removed: I have provided ſecure fortifications to preſerve thee, when thou art hunted and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on every hand: Come now, and let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe together, for therein I take pleaſure. <hi>Mark it,</hi> nothing is ſo welcome to Jeſus Chriſt, as the voice and countenance of his Saints: If they do but chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a Crane or Swallow,

               <p n="8">8. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 8. <hi>The eighth and laſt Propoſition is this.</hi> The myſtical union of Believers with Chriſt, and all the priviledges and bleſſings which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents thereof, do originally flow from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the death of the Lord Jeſus: which, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the eternal Covenant between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himſelf, he ſuffered in their ſtead; and whereby he gave ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, in their behalf. To this end he undertook to be a Mediator, and to die an accurſed death in their room; and in the fulneſs of time he actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, that they in whoſe ſtead he ſtood might be gathered unto him, and by the Spirit and faith might be made one with him.

This I take to be clear, from the Scriptures of truth; That the <hi>myſtical Union</hi> of Believers with Chriſt, wrought by the Spirit and faith (which is the matter we are treating of) and until which they are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and under the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64514:106"/>wrath of God as well as others; is a fruit of Chriſt's undertaking to die for them, and actual perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that undertaking.

You ſhall find that their gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Chriſt, and being implanted into him is mentioned as an effect of his undertaking and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for them. This is notably ſet forth in that <hi>Anti-Socinian</hi> Chapter (as I may call it) which hath broken the teeth of ſuch as have been nibling at it, and out of which it is impoſſible for them, with all their ſubtle devices, to extricate themſelves. I mean, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. v. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed; he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied: by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death; and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors: and he bare the ſins of many, and made interceſſion for tranſgreſſors.</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:64514:106"/>Mark, but how abundantly this point is confirmed. Therefore ſhall Chriſt have a people gathered unto him, and a ſeed to ſerve him: becauſe he made his ſoul an offering for their ſins. Upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, many ſhall be united to him, ſo as to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by him; becauſe he bare their iniquities. Therefore he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong; becauſe he poured out his ſoul unto death. <hi>How doth Chriſt divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong? Why,</hi> when in the day of converſion he knittetn ſinners unto himſelf. As Satan the ſtrong man armed hath his company, that continue finally impenitent in their wickedneſs: So Chriſt by his Spirit doth gather a company unto himſelf. And <hi>whence doth this proceed? Why,</hi> it is the product of the ſatisfaction which he made for them. Thus it ſhall be, becauſe he bare the ſins of many. Theſe are the trophies of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Chriſt got, by dying the death of the croſs. They are ingraffed into him, becauſe he ſuffered for them. Hence the grace of faith, which is the uniting grace, is ſaid to be attained through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. As it is acted upon Chriſt's righteouſneſs, ſo it was purchaſed thereby, and is given forth upon the account thereof, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To them that have obtained like precious faith with us, through the righteouſneſs of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>laſt Propoſition.</hi> For the clearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the point aſſerted, I will take it aſunder into five heads of obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſerve.</hi> That the eternal tranſactions of matters between God the Father and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in order to the redemption and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the elect, are ſet forth in the Scriptures, under the notion of a Covenant, that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

So I conceive it may be underſtood. Or if you will have it rather to relate to the Kingly and Prieſtly Offices of Chriſt, yet it will hold nevertheleſs, that there was a conſultation in heaven, for reconciling of the world: which Chriſt as King and Prieſt was to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. In this Covenant and compact between the Father and Chriſt, for the redemption of ſinners; the Lord Jeſus undertook to put himſelf under the Law, and to bear the curſe of the Law: to give up himſelf unto death, and ſo to carry on their ſalvation. In the conſultation between them, it was found, that nothing elſe could ſatisfie for the wrong done by ſin; and therefore there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to deliver the ſinners, but by the death of Chriſt. God the Father promiſed unto the Son, That if by his death ſatisfaction were made, then the ſinners ſhould be delivered, they ſhould be put into Chriſt's hands to be ſaved upon thoſe terms:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64514:108"/>And our Lord Jeſus cloſed with this propoſal, he accepted the offer, and undertook to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, by dying and ſuffering. We have both the branches of that everlaſting Covenant in the Scriptures. 1. <hi>God's promiſe of ſalvation,</hi> made to Chriſt, in the behalf of his children, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lye, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before the world began.</hi> Mark it, All the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to Believers, are made in time; but here is a promiſe of ſalvation from eternity: And unto whom could that be made, but unto Chriſt, for ſuch as ſhould believe in him? 2. <hi>Chriſt's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to ſatisfie divine juſtice,</hi> by humbling himſelf unto the death: in that famous place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. quoted out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body thou haſt prepared me: In burnt offerings and ſacrifices for ſin, thou hadſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Then I ſaid, Lo I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> This was the way, wherein the Father would have ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wrought out, for loſt ſinners: and Chriſt taketh it upon himſelf to accompliſh the will of God in that behalf. <hi>This is the ſecond Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſerve in the next place,</hi> That our Lord Jeſus, in dying and ſatisfying the juſtice of God, for the ſins of Believers according to what he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, did not only die and ſuffer for their good and benefit; but he died <hi>in their stead,</hi> and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their room; <hi>that is;</hi> he underwent that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by the rigour of the Law they ſhould have undergone; and took upon himſelf that curſe, which in the ſtrictneſs of juſtice would have fallen down upon their heads. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>The
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64514:109"/>Lord laid their iniquities upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53.6. All the ſins of God's elect were made to meet together, and laid upon his ſhoulders to bear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8. <hi>In due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> And, <hi>whilſt we were ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> that is, in our ſtead and room.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To bring this home to our purpoſe, <hi>obſerve,</hi> That the end of Chriſt's undertaking thus to die, and of his actual dying in the ſtead and behalf of loſt ſinners, was that in due time they might be knit and united unto him; and ſo partake of the ſalvation which he purchaſed for them.

               <p n="5">5. This ſatisfaction and merit of the death of Chriſt, although it was laid down for the benefit of ſuch as the Father had given him, and he ſuffered in their ſtead; yet doth make no change upon them, till they are drawn unto Chriſt, and by the Spirit
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64514:109"/>and faith made one with him. Until this grace be wrought in them, or conferred upon them, they are ſtill <hi>children of the wrath of God as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3. <hi>The wrath of God abideth on them, Joh.</hi> 3.36. They are amongſt the unrighteous, which, remaining in that condition, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. And if we could ſuppoſe them to die before converſion, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed it is not to be ſuppoſed) they would periſh unavoidably, even as others. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this; Although Chriſt died in their ſtead, and laid down a price for purchaſe of their pardon, and ſalvation; and God the Father accepted thereof: yet it was agreed between them, in that everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, that an order ſhould be obſerved in conveying thoſe mercies, and making them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally partakers of the benefit thereof. <hi>Which order is this,</hi> Firſt they muſt be ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, and brought by faith unto him, and made one with him, and ſo receive ſalvation through his blood. <hi>For till they have the Son, they can have no life by the Son.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. And principally, It is an <hi>inſeparable,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble Union;</hi> ſuch as ſhall never be broken aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. When Chriſt and a Believer are once knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they ſhall never be parted any more. When the Lord Jeſus cometh by his Spirit, and taketh up his abode in a mans ſoul, he maketh that ſoul his eternal manſion; and doth not at any time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from it: And when the ſinner is by a living faith gotten into Chriſt, he ſhall in no caſe be broken off from him. A dead branch may fall off from the tree, but the living branches will abide
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64514:110"/>there for ever, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27, 28. <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the ſame anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye: and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him. And now little children abide in him,</hi> &amp;c. As here is an exhortation preſſing Believers to abide in Chriſt; ſo here is a word of promiſe, that they ſhall abide in him: and that as to both the branches of this conjunction. 1. <hi>The anointing which ye have received, abideth in you;</hi> that is, The principle of grace infuſed into you, which was typified by the unctions or anointings in the ceremonial Law, which was ſignified by the precious ointment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that ran down to the skirts of his garments; this principle will prove indefectible. 2. On the other hand, <hi>ye ſhall abide in him,</hi> Your faith is a grace that ſhall not fail, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. This is clear from the reaſon that is given of the apoſtacy of ſome, That therefore they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Chriſt, becauſe they were never ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually ingraffed into Chriſt,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon the <hi>unchangeableneſs of the purpoſe of God concerning believers, and the never failingneſs of his love towards them:</hi> whereby he did elect and fore-ordain them to everlaſting life, and ſet them apart for the eternal enjoyment of himſelf. This purpoſe of God cannot be fruſtrated or diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. His counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will perform all his pleaſure: and the love of God towards his choſen is not a tranſient fleeting; but an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. And therefore when he hath gathered a people unto Chriſt, he will never ſuffer them to be divided from him again: For that love which moved him to ſhew compaſſion upon them, and to

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> The foundation of God] <hi>that is,</hi> the eternal purpoſe, and electing love of God, upon which the ſalvation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is built, as upon a ſure ground-work: This cannot be ſhaken; that any of them ſhould fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to perdition, whom God hath choſen to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. And <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his; q. d.</hi> It is true, the faith of ſome may be overthrown, who were never ſound in the faith; but not a perſon who is the Lord's indeed, ſhall ever miſcarry: for their perſeverance is built upon a ſure foundation, <hi>namely,</hi> upon the electing love of God that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The indiſſolubleneſs of this union is built, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the nature of the Covenant made with believers; and the truth and faithfulneſs of God in keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them.</hi> It is ſuch a laſting Covenant as is confirmed with an oath, whereby the Lord hath manifeſted the unchangeableneſs of his counſel: And wherein he hath made proviſion for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and performance of the articles which are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64514:112"/>on their part to be diſcharged; as well as for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the mercies, which he is ingaged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey thereupon. This you have often ſpoken of as the ground of their eſtabliſhment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8, 9, 10. <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with ever laſting kindneſs I will have mercy upon thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer. For this is as the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>unto me: for as I have ſworn that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhould no more go over the earth; ſo have I ſworn that I would not be wrath with thee, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee. For the mountains ſhall depart, and the hills ſhall be removed, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, As ſure as the day and night ſhall not fail, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I ſware unto <hi>Noah</hi> after the flood; ſo ſure my mercy ſhall not fail towards you, not ſhall ye at any hand fall ſhort of it; for I have made it over unto you by a covenant, confirmed with an oath.</p>
               <p>It is one remarkable difference between the <hi>word of God,</hi> and <hi>his oath;</hi> That ſometimes a word of promiſe is made under certain exceptions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions implyed: upon the failure whereof, God may repent of the good which he promiſed to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 9, 10. But when the Lord ſweareth, he will not repent; <hi>That</hi> is a certain token of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his counſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Now, the perſeverance of the Saints is a mercy which God hath ſworn to give unto them, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.73, 74, 75. <hi>The oath which he ſware to our father</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he would grant us, That we being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear: in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the dayes of our lives.</hi> Not only that we ſhould
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64514:112"/>be admitted into his ſervice, but likewiſe abide therein unto the death. And for the <hi>freeneſs of the Covenant,</hi> wherein God hath graciouſly obliged himſelf, not only to perform the mercy promiſed; but alſo to aſſiſt believers with his Spirit for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty required at their hands, ſo as not to fall ſhort of that mercy: Take that noted place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them and of their children after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The indiſſolveableneſs of the union between Believers and the Lord Jeſus, is built <hi>upon the charge that is given unto Chriſt concerning them, and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in accompliſhing what he hath undertaken for them.</hi> Thus <hi>Sirs,</hi> when God the Father did put all his elect into Chriſt's hands, and conſtituted and ordained him to be a Mediator for them, it was with this expreſs charge; <hi>That he ſhould conduct them to glory.</hi> Not only that he ſhould gather them unto himſelf, and give them ſpiritual life; but that he ſhould guide them with ſafety to the kingdom of heaven. And this charge he undertook, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life, to as many as thou haſt given him,</hi> Heb. 2.10. <hi>In bringing many ſons to glory.</hi> Now in purſuance of this undertaking Chriſt doth kni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them to himſelf <hi>inſeparably;</hi> that he may be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſteward of the grace of God. It is the very reaſon which our Saviour giveth, why no man ſhall pluck Believers out of his hands; becauſe he is to give them eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. And the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64514:113"/>Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> put much ſtreſs upon it, when he prayeth for the ſettlement of Believers in the faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>But the God of all grace, who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us into his eternal glory, by Chriſt Jeſus, after that ye have ſuffered a while, make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you.</hi> Here is a bundle of arguments to incourage our dependance upon God, for our abiding in Chriſt. There is ſcarcely a word but hath an <hi>emphaſis</hi> upon it, to that purpoſe. 1. <hi>It is God</hi> that ſtrengthens you; he that is able to do it, and is on your ſide: ſo that greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. All your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are but <hi>creatures,</hi> who labour to draw you away, but he that eſtabliſheth you is the <hi>Creator;</hi> God bleſſed for ever. <hi>It is God,</hi> whoſe wayes are perfect, that is not wont to carry on his deſigns by halfs, and to leave them in the mid-way, unfiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that cannot be diſappointed in the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his counſels. 2. It is <hi>the God of grace,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and giver of grace, and who aimeth at the magnifying of the riches of his grace in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people; and therefore will certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, and not ſuffer them to fall back, and periſh from the right way. 3. He is the <hi>God of all grace,</hi> of ſtrengthening, and perſevering, as well as of the firſt converting, and ſanctifying grace. 4. It is that God <hi>who hath called us,</hi> and therefore will not forſake us utterly, now we are called. To what end do you think did he bring you into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with himſelf, if he purpoſed afterwards to reject you, and let you periſh for ever? certainly he that hath begun a good work in you, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it until the day of Chriſt. If whilſt you were enemies he reconciled you unto himſelf, and took you into the bond of the Covenant with himſelf:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64514:113"/>it cannot be imagined, that he will now caſt you out of his favour. If when ye were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, he quickned you; much more being quickned, ye ſhall be ſaved through his grace. 5. It is he that <hi>called you by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly carry on the work which he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Indeed if God had put your happineſs into your own keeping again, you might have loſt it, as <hi>Adam</hi> did at the firſt: But he hath put it into the hands of his own Son, who is a faithful Truſtee. And he hath done it to this end, <hi>that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> Wherefore do ye think did God lay ſuch a ſure foundation, and build his people upon the rock, but that the wind and ſtormes might not overturn the building? 6. It is that God who hath called us unto <hi>glory, unto eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> not only to have fellowſhip with him for a time here, but to ſit down with him in his kingdom for ever. And how ſhould that be attained, if he ſhould ſuffer you to be ſeparated from his Son, and to draw back unto perdition? Undoubtedly you may go to this God, with a full aſſurance of faith, to make you perfect, to ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle you. That is <hi>the third founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on which the inſeparableneſs of this Union is built.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is built upon the <hi>Advocateſhip and interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lord Jeſus, which he is making for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers at the right hand of the Father.</hi> For as he came into the world to give ſatisfaction for them, unto the juſtice of God; ſo he entred into heaven, by vertue of that ſatisfaction, to plead for mercy in their behalf: And this is one of the mercies which he pleadeth for; That they may abide in him for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64514:114"/>ever, and may not at any time be parted from him. God the Father heareth his Son alwayes, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him whatever petition he maketh for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this is one of the great petitions which he preſenteth; that whilſt his ſervants are in the world, they may be kept from the evil of the world: that as they are knit to him, ſo they may never be divided from him, till they arrive with ſafety where he is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.15, 24. And it is noted as one of the foundations, whereupon the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility of a Chriſtians faith is bottomed; and conſequently of their Union with Chriſt, which is made up thereby, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Simon, Simon, <hi>behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; q. d.</hi> The great deſign of the devil is to root out your faith. He knoweth if that grace fail, other graces will fail with it: if your faith be gone, your union with me is diſſolved and broken aſunder: But for thy comfort, I aſſure thee of the contrary, Thought it be ſtrongly aſſaulted, yet it ſhall never be utterly vanquiſhed; though it may be battered, yet it ſhall not be wholly overcome; though it may be kept under a little, yet it ſhall in no wiſe be rooted up. Whence doth this proceed? <hi>Why,</hi> from Chriſt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, it ſhall not fail, for <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The inſeparableneſs of a believers union with Chriſt, is built upon <hi>the mighty power by which they are upheld; and whereby they are preſerved in Chriſt:</hi> and that is the infinite, unlimited, and almighty power of God. All the power in heaven is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their defence. This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64514:114"/>for our incouragement, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> As the inheritance is reſerved in heaven for you, ſo ye are kept and preſerved for it. Yea, but Satan our adverſary is a roaring Lion, that ſeeketh to devour us; and what if he ſhould pluck us out of the hands of our keeper? <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Your keeper is God, the Lord of Hoſts, who hath ingaged his ſtrength for your preſervation: He is able to bruiſe Satan under your feet. Is not he that delivered you at firſt out of the paw of that Lion, of ſtrength ſufficient to keep you? The work is eaſier in it ſelf to keep Satan out, when he is diſpoſſeſſed; than at firſt to caſt him out of his poſſeſſion; to keep ſin under, when it is ſubdued; than at firſt to ſubdue it. <hi>Beſides,</hi> God is omnipotent, there is nothing too hard for him; you have his power for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who is greater than all; <hi>and none can pluck you out of his hands,</hi> Joh. 10.29.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, it is built upon <hi>the durable nature of the new creature;</hi> or the graces of the Spirit, whereby Chriſt is formed in the ſouls of believers; and they are faſhioned after his likeneſs. It is a ſeed which is of a permanent nature, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him: neither can he ſin, becauſe he is born of God, i. e.</hi> He doth not ſin allowedly, and cuſtomarily, as the wicked do; he doth not give up himſelf to ſerve his luſts; for he hath a ſeed within him; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle, which is contrary to ſin, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againſt it, and hath the ſupremacy in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But what if that ſeed ſhould be loſt? would he not then return with the dog to his vomit? yea, but ſaith the holy Ghoſt, It ſhall not be loſt; for the principle of grace is a divine principle; not only
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64514:115"/>infuſed and put into the ſoul, but faſt riveted into the ſoul. Herein it differs from the habits put into the nature of man at firſt: They were of divine original, but they were loſeable; but when grace is reſtored under the ſecond Covenant, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be loſt. It is an indefectible principle, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſeed; If not in it ſelf, yet in reſpect of the fountain whence it is derived, <hi>namely,</hi> from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath the fulneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and is ſtill following his people with freſh influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof.

               <p n="1">1. The firſt thing that is moſt likely to diſunite a Believer from the Lord Jeſus, is the <hi>remainders of ſin, and that by way of provocation.</hi> There are many corruptions left in the hearts of the children of God; and thereupon frequent infirmities and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the courſe of their obedience: ſometimes foul miſcarriages committed in their lives. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>grace doth ever act like it ſelf,</hi> (ſin cannot grow upon that root) yet <hi>a gracious man doth not alwayes act like himſelf.</hi> Now the queſtion may be, Will not theſe pollutions provoke the Lord Chriſt to abandon their ſociety? Will he hold any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64514:116"/>and fellowſhip with them, that are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed? May not they juſtly expect, that this ſhould ſeparate between them? <hi>Why mark it Sirs,</hi> ſin in the godly ſhall never come ſo high, as to make a ſeparation between them and their Redeemer. It may ſomewhat interrupt their communion, and hinder them from taſting that uſual ſweetneſs, that is to be taſted, in fellowſhip with Chriſt: but it ſhall never break aſunder their union with him. For the <hi>power and dominion of ſin</hi> over them when they lay we tring in their blood, would rather have hindred the making them one at firſt; than the <hi>preſence of ſin</hi> ſhall diſſolve that union, when it is made. If Chriſt ſent forth his Spirit to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them, when they were ſlaves of the devil, that he might dwell in them; certainly he will not utterly reject them, becauſe of their infirmities, when they are ſanctified; and become the children of God. If he had mercy upon them, when they were in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity, and knit them unto himſelf; ſurely he will not caſt them off, now they are members of his body. The Apoſtle preſſeth it as a forcible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. <hi>God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us: Much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his life.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Undoubtedly our ſtate of enmity againſt God, would rather have prevented our reconciliation; than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin can now prevent our ſalvation. There is nothing can be imagined to come in now as an obſtacle in the way of our ſalvation; but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64514:116"/>would have much more proved an obſtacle to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede our converſion. If we were ingraffed into Chriſt, through the ſuperabundant love of God, notwithſtanding our former walking in a courſe of ſin: without controverſie we ſhall abide in Chriſt, he will never withdraw from us, becauſe of ſome unallowed failings. And beſides, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> that when Chriſt married believers unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and gave up himſelf unto them, he did it in judgment. He did not act raſhly, and in conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but he knew well enough their frame, what creatures they were, to what failings they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and what remainders of corruption would ſtill abide in them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercies.</hi> And that promiſe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32. <hi>If his children forſake my law, and walk not in my judgments: if they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes: nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take away from them, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Mark it, God doth own them as the children of Chriſt notwithſtanding their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold infirmities. Though he may correct them, in his fatherly diſpleaſure, for their ſins; yet he will never wholly forſake them: The continuance of his love being not bottomed on their abſolute perfection in the faith; but upon his own faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing which is moſt likely, but ſhall not be able to prevail to diſſolve this union, is, <hi>The violent aſſaults of the devil, by way of temptation.</hi> He is a potent and cunning adverſary, and will be ready to put forth all his ſtrength and ſubtlety
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64514:117"/>againſt the children of God; to make them loſe their hold of Chriſt, and if it were poſſible to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate betwixt them and the Lord Jeſus. And this is the very ground of the deſpondency of poor affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſpirits. When they are ſtrongly buffetted by Satan from without, and find their luſts ſtirring within, they are apt to yield up the cauſe, and to ſay in their hearts, <hi>We ſhall one day periſh by the hands of Saul:</hi> we ſhall never be able to hold out againſt this powerful aſſailant. But mind it <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this ſhould much excite you to watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, yet here is no cauſe of diſcouragement. Is Satan a potent enemy? yet he is a conquered ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. That Chriſt who dwelleth in you, hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the power of hell, and brought under the prince of darkneſs. His temptations ſhould quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you to run to Chriſt for ſuccour, and to claſp the faſter about him, and in no wiſe to caſt off your confidence. A ſincere believer in this caſe, ſhould recollect himſelf with <hi>David, Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> Is not my Saviour ſtronger than the ſtrong man arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Can it be imagined that he delivered me out of the ſnare of the devil, that he might give me up again unto his will? Did he break in with a mighty force upon my ſoul, and eject the devil out of his habitation, and come and dwell in me; that afterwards he might ſurrender up his dwelling place to his greateſt adverſary? <hi>Why,</hi> Satan by being mine enemy, is Chriſt's enemy thereby; in whom I am, and unto whom I am cloſely united; and he wil never ſuffer him to get the victory. Although he may permit him to vex and diſquiet me for a time, that my faith may be exerciſed,
<note n="*" place="margin">Deus bonos non negligit cum negligit: nec obliviſcitur, ſed quaſi obliviſcitur. Ideo videtur deferere, quia non vult deſeri.</note> yet he will
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64514:117"/>bruiſe him under my feet ſhortly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Mark,</hi> how he rebuketh the devil in the caſe of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Zech. 3.2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord who hath choſen</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>rebuke thee: is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire? q.d.</hi> Have I preſerved him to this time by a ſpecial preſervation, that now I might deliver him into thy mercileſs hands? <hi>So,</hi> doth Chriſt pluck poor ſouls as firebrands out of the fire of the wrath of God, and gather them into his own kingdom; that afterwards he may give them up to the prince of darkneſs? <hi>Mat</hi> 16.18. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> The gates of bell] <hi>that is,</hi> all the power and policy, all the might and craft of the devil and his adhaerents. The gates of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were the places where their arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were laid up; and there their Judges and Counſellors were wont to meet, and adviſe for the good of the place. So that by <hi>the gates of hell</hi> is meant, the ſtrength and crafty machinations and devices of Satan and his inſtruments: they may trouble and vex the Saints of the moſt High, but they ſhall not prevail againſt them: not againſt the meaneſt faithful member of the Church; becauſe they are built upon the rock. For it is not only the Church in general that is built upon that rock, but every particular Saint. <hi>Behold I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third particular that is moſt likely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite a Believer and the Lord Jeſus, is, <hi>The allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world.</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations <hi>objected,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Temptations are, 1. <hi>Injected,</hi> ſuch as the tempter darts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the ſoul. 2. <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> which ariſe from ſome ſtirred humour or inferior fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. 3. <hi>Objected,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from external objects, baited and ſuited to the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit.</note> (as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64514:118"/>the Schools diſtinguiſh) the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life; as the Apoſtle giveth us <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory</hi> of all the worlds goods, and accommodations, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. Theſe were the very engines whereby our firſt parents were ſeduced: and commonly they have a great influence on the ſouls of their poſterity. To follow after which ſome have <hi>made ſhipwrack of faith, and put a good conſcience far away from them.</hi> For the pleaſures of ſin, they have forſaken Chriſt: and for earthly profit and advantage have let go the purſuit of heavenly bleſſings: and to get honour of men, have neglected that honour that cometh of God only. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>John</hi> 12.42, 43. But theſe are outſide Chriſtians, who thus forſake their ſtation, and run away from their Maſter:
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Charitas quae deſcri poteſt, nunquam vera fuit.</hi> Aug.</note> Such as are indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into Chriſt, will never let him go: For they have renounced theſe things already for his ſake; when they firſt gave themſelves unto the Lord, it was upon theſe terms, That they ſhould be ready to ſuffer the loſs of all things at his command. They find in the enjoyment of Chriſt more ſolid and ſubſtantial pleaſure, than ſin can miniſter unto its followers; and greater riches than the whole earth can afford: They account it their higheſt dignity and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be in him, and of the number of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: They ſee <hi>that</hi> in the Covenant, which doth infinitely out-bid the world, in all that it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto them that ſerve it. <hi>Beſides,</hi> Through the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64514:118"/>Croſs of Chriſt the world is crucified unto Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and they are crucified unto it, and redeemed from it: So that it cannot have that power and prevalency over them, as upon others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Falſe teachers and ſeducers</hi> may be thought likely to diſſolve this union. They have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cunning artifices to deceive, and are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence to gain <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and to make them the children of hell. They are wont to come as meſſengers of righteouſneſs, and transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to high attainments, and plead the Spirit, and new light, for introducing their abominations. And may not <hi>theſe ſubtle emiſſaries of the devil</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the faith of God's people? May not they ſo prevail, as to make a ſeparation between Believers and Chriſt? <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> the holy Ghoſt hath given ſufficient warrant to aſſure us it ſhall not be. They may lead captive ſilly, unſettled perſons, who are laden with ſins, and led away with divers luſts: They may beguil unſtable ſouls, who though they have been in the School of Chriſt, were never taught the truth <hi>as it is in Jeſus:</hi> Nay, they may poſſibly <hi>fly blow</hi> the ſouls of Chriſts peculiar ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with wretched errors, and taint their faith; but they ſhall not be able to overturn their faith: For the foundation of God ſtands ſure, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aſſerteth expreſsly in this reſpect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18, 19. And therefore their ſeductions are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as to deceiving the elect, with an <hi>[if it were poſſible] Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very elect.</hi> Intimating that <hi>eventually</hi> it is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64514:119"/>impoſſible: they are placed out of harms way, they are put through grace without the reach of their gunſhot, as to a total ſeduction from the faith: as having an unction from the holy One, whereby they know all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. Not that this ſhould imbolden the godly to be tampering with errors: If a man will tread upon hot coals, his feet may be burnt and ſcorched, though withal his life may be preſerved. But this ſhould make you the rather heedful, to ſtick faſt unto the truth; that it may be evident you are ſuch as they have no power over to lead aſide into the error of the wicked. It is the very particular conſideration which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> preſſeth upon Believers, why they ſhould not hearken unto ſeducers, when they teach for doctrines mens inventions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth notions of their own: Becauſe they were ſufficiently taught of Chriſt, and his word was a plentiful directory unto them, without the help of other additions: and becauſe they ſhould abide in Chriſt; therefore they were not to be followers of falſe teachers, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.26, 27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Troubles and perſecutions for the ſake of Chriſt ſhall not be able to diſſolve this union.</hi> They may ſeem to be providences very likely to do it: When Chriſtians ſhall be dragged into priſons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged of their comforts, and reduced into hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and extremities; when they ſhall have trial of cruel mockings and reproaches, yea moreover of ſcourgings, and torturings in the ſevereſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the wicked heart of man can invent: and when all theſe things might be avoided, if they would but part with Chriſt. Will not ſuch ſore perſecutions from the world, drive them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for deliverance into the world, out of which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64514:119"/>they were called? <hi>Do but mark,</hi> how confident the Apoſtle is of the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or peril, or ſword? (As it is written, for thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are acounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter.) Nay in all theſe things we are more than conquerours, through him that loved us.</hi> How more than conquerours? <hi>Why, q. d.</hi> We are ſo far from being foiled, that we are brought off with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: our faith is thereby fourbiſhed, and our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſtrengthened, our other graces are quickned, and our experiences increaſed. When conquerours get a victory over their enemies, it is ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but with ſome loſs to themſelves; but we are gainers by our troubles. Our ſpiritual ſtrength is augmented, and our vigour heightened to a more intenſe degree, and we come purified as gold out of the fire of tribulation. So that we can glory in it; <hi>For tribulation worketh patience, and patience brings experience, and experience begetteth hope, and hope mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts.</hi> As you have it in that <hi>climax</hi> or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>In the winter of adverſity the leaves drop off, and the withered boughs are pared away; but the living branches abide. And the reaſon of it is this, Becauſe when Chriſt bringeth his people into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and trouble for his Name, he hath promiſed to ſtand by them, and to afford them ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their ſupport, under thoſe diſtreſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt; neither ſhall the flame kindle upon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64514:120"/>thee.</hi> When Chriſt reduceth them into ſuch ſtraits, as they never had experience of; he will then mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to them ſuch ſtrength and aſſiſtance, as they never had before experience of. As ſure as he is a God of faithfulneſs he will do it; according to that precious word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able: but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> But may ſome poor diſconſolate ſoul ſay, I may quickly be called into temptations and troubles, and I find no ſtrength nor ability, O what is like to become of me at ſuch a ſeaſon? I am afraid I ſhall ſink under the burden. <hi>Why,</hi> mind the promiſe, he will do it <hi>with the temptation:</hi> It is not ſaid he will give ability before the trial; but when you are called to uſe it, you ſhall not fail of it: You ſhall have it time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt you have occaſion to exerciſe it. My brethren, it is an excellent word of promiſe, an eſtabliſhing word, if we had hearts to believe. And indeed it is according to what the Saints of God have experimentally found. How faint-hearted was Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> in the dayes of Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi> and very doubtful of himſelf, till he was actually brought into ſufferings? How dead-ſpirited was Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> till he was reduced to the pinch? and then he could cry out, <hi>He is come, He is come.</hi> Nay how cowardly and full of fear was <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, till he was ingaged in his work? as appeareth from the excuſes he made to evade the imployment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.1, 10, 13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Death it ſelf,</hi> which is the great ſeparating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that parts between a man &amp; all his worldly accommodations, that parts between friends and kinsfolks, between brethren &amp; ſiſters, &amp; the neareſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64514:120"/>and deareſt relations, <hi>ſhall not ſeparate believers from Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But ſtill they are entirely in him, even when they are dead. As it was in the death of Chriſt himſelf, though it made a ſeparation <hi>between his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul,</hi> yet it did not ſeparate <hi>the humane nature from the divine:</hi> So it is in the death of the Saints, Though it rend the ſpirit from the fleſh, yet it can part <hi>neither</hi> from the Son of God. The very bodies of Believers are ſtill united unto Jeſus, even when they are dead; and ſhall be raiſed up again <hi>(as I will ſhew you afterwards)</hi> by vertue of that conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore they are ſaid to <hi>ſleep in Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſs. 4.14. and, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev.</hi> 14.13. It is not ſaid only, They that die <hi>for the Lord,</hi> but <hi>in the Lord.</hi> A man may ſuffer death, in ſome caſes, for the true Religion, that never was ſincere therein: But if a perſon <hi>die in Jeſus,</hi> then he is bleſſed indeed. Upon the upſhot of all, I may well conclude this point with that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in anſwer <hi>as it were,</hi> to this queſtion we are upon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? q. d.</hi> Is a Believers union with Chriſt a diſſolveable union, or not? Can it be broken aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Or, <hi>if you will,</hi> rather underſtand it by way of aſſertion, though delivered interrogatively: For nothing is more ordinary than for affirmative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations to denote a vehement denial of the matter queſtioned. <hi>As if he had ſaid,</hi> This union is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inſeparable; nothing can part betwixt a Believer and Chriſt. So faſt are they glewed and linked together, that they ſhall never be divided, or broken aſunder again. For ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64514:121"/>ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> That's <hi>the ſecond thing</hi> I intended, <hi>for the confirmation of this property of a Believers union with Chriſt,</hi> viz. the inſeparable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A little to <hi>vindicate this point</hi> from the grand exceptions thas are made againſt it, I will lay down only <hi>two rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule.</hi> 1. <hi>This doctrine of the perſeverance of a ſincere Believer in the faith,</hi> or the inſeparableneſs of his union with Chriſt, <hi>is ſo far</hi> in it ſelf, <hi>from being as enemy to practical holineſs and new obedience, that</hi> if rightly improved <hi>it will be a mighty incentive and provocative thereunto.</hi> It will have a powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to inlarge a mans heart, to run the ſteps of God's commandments; and to cauſe him to take heed unto himſelf, to continue upright and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in the way of the Lord. This aſſertion I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to obviate the <hi>main cavil and objection</hi> that is made againſt this comfortable truth. For there is an aſperſion caſt upon it, as if it were not a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to godlineſs: as if it did miniſter occaſion to ſlothfulneſs, and careleſsneſs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity. They will be ready to ſay, <hi>who are the oppoſers of this truth,</hi> if a perſon be in Chriſt, ſo as to be ſure he ſhall in no caſe be ſeparated from him; then they will be apt to think they may live as they liſt: that they may take what liberty they pleaſe, to indulge the fleſh, and ſatisfie their luſts, and walk in a way of licentiouſneſs; ſeeing whatever they do, they ſhall abide in a ſtate of grace, and come ſafe to heaven at the laſt, Thus a door, <hi>ſay they,</hi> would be opened to all manner of wickedneſs. But <hi>mind it Sirs,</hi> It is a calumny falſely laid to the charge of this doctrine: For in it ſelf, it is a ſtrong
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64514:121"/>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and motive unto holineſs: It is a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that may have a tendency to the mortifying ſin, and awakening the Spirit, if rightly preſſed on the ſoul: and thus it will be improved by a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart.

So hath it befallen this particular point of the Saints perſeverance; though in its proper cauſality, it will help to cleanſe a man from all the filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, and make him vigorouſly to purſue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of holineſs. See what uſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 13.

Will not you be aſhamed to ſin againſt him, who hath in every reſpect dealt ſo bountifully with you? If the Lord has not been unmindful of ſecuring your ſalvation, will not you mind his honour, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his conduct? Should not this mightily prevail upon you, never to caſt off this God, but to cleave unto him unto the end? O ſet diligently, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly, about your work; be ready and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all the wayes of holineſs, and to continue ſtedfaſt, and unmoveable therein. Do not walk as the generality of people walk, nor as your ſelves have formerly walked: for God hath called you out of the world, and prepared for you a kingdom; and taketh care of your preſervation, that you may come to the enjoyment of it. <hi>This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe of this doctrine;</hi> which will plainly appear, if you ſeriouſly weigh theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath not promiſed to preſerve his people in the ſtate of grace, and union with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>whether they be holy or no,</hi> or <hi>however they walk:</hi> But the promiſe is to keep them <hi>in the exerciſe of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64514:122"/>grace</hi> &amp; <hi>in the ways of holineſs</hi> that ſo they may not be ſeparated from him. If any repreſent it in another dreſs, it is not the Scripture doctrine of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but they endeavour to caſt a ſlurre upon it. We do not teach, that God hath ingaged to bring his people ſafely to heaven, let them live as they liſt: or, that he will keep them from falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Chriſt, though they caſt off the fear of the Lord, and run to all exceſs of riot: But God hath ingaged to inable them to live the life of the juſt, and to cauſe them to fear his Name, and through the Spirit to mortifie the deeds of the body, that ſo they may never draw back to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto ſalvation.</hi> It is not ſaid, God will keep them by his almighty power, whether they believe or no: but he will ſuodue their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and ſet their faith on work, in order to their being ſecured, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Mark, it is not ſaid, They ſhall never depart from G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſeriouſly pondering it in the heart, by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that God hath ſo knit them unto his Son, that they ſhall be ſtill growing up into him, and never be ſeparated from him, <hi>will be of notable effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to draw forth their love back again to the Lord and to kindle is their breaſts a fervent affection towards him.</hi> Which love ſo kindled, is a mighty quickner to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Love is a commanding paſſion, that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64514:123"/>will ſet all the powers of a mans ſoul on work, to pleaſe the party that is beloved. It will level moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and make rough wayes ſmooth, and no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties will deter it. What will not a man do for one whom he dearly loveth? You know what is ſaid of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 29, 20. Although he ſerved ſeven years hard ſervice for <hi>Rachel,</hi> the drought conſumed him by day, and the froſt by night, and his ſleep departed from his eyes; yet it was as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him, becauſe he loved her. <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> a pure, entire, and affectionate love to God, would cauſe men willingly to ſpend themſelves in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: it would make them very cautious and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſt they ſhould diſhonour him, or ſin againſt him. Now this great priviledge of an indiſſoluble union with Chriſt, will mightily inflame the heart with affection, and ſtir up a perſon to thankfulneſs. <hi>Will the ſoul of a Believer be thus arguing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> hath the Lord Chriſt been pleaſed not only to give me a tranſitory glimps of his favour, (which yet was more than ever I deſerved) but taken me into everlaſting fellowſhip with him? <hi>O what ſhall I render to the Lord?</hi> How ſhall I ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my readineſs to ſerve him? Wherein may I be inſtrumental to ſhew forth his praiſe? Surely I will cleave to this God as long as I live, and call upon him whilſt I have a being: I will never more rebel againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.23. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints, for the Lord preſerveth the faithful.</hi> If it be meant of temporal preſervation; of how much greater force will the argument be upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſpiritual grace and eſtabliſhment? How ſhould a Believer ſay with <hi>David? Pſal.</hi> 116.1, 2. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard the voice of my ſupplications: Becauſe he hath inclined his ear to me, I
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64514:123"/>will call upon him as long as I live.</hi> Surely, it is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unacquaintedneſs with the workings of the Spirit in a ſanctified heart, that makes men think doctrines of free grace are incouragements to ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The conſideration of the inſeparableneſs of a Believers union with Chriſt, <hi>ſhould cauſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to entertain a holy jealouſie, and ſuſpition over his own ſoul; leſt at any time he ſhould draw back from the faith:</hi> That by his fixedneſs in the wayes of God, it may more abundantly appear, that his profeſſion of godlineſs was a ſincere profeſſion. For if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are unſtedfaſt in the Covenant of God, it will be a ſhrewd evidence that their hearts were not right with him. If they do not hold on their way in the practiſe of godlineſs, it will be manifeſt that they went no further, than the form of godlineſs carried them. So that <hi>the doctrine of perſeverance is an awakening doctrine:</hi> It ſhould awaken us to be watchful over our ſelves, and to work out our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling. For then <hi>we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold faſt the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end,</hi> Heb. 3.14. That is, then it will evidently appear, that we are partakers of him, and have a ſhare in his death. If we ſall away from Chriſt, it will be an undeniable token, that we were never ſpiritually ingraffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A due meditating upon the inſeparableneſs of a Believers union with the Lord Jeſus, <hi>will incourage the ſoul of that believer in reſiſting, and repelling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations of the devil;</hi> and ſtanding faſt againſt all ſollicitations to ſin. Through grace (<hi>thinks a godly man</hi>) I ſhall get the victory, and therefore I will ſtir up my ſtrength to the fight. I ſee it is not in vain
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64514:124"/>to ſtrive againſt the wicked one. If God ſhould leave his children in their own hands, to ſtand or fall according to the exerciſe of their own power; then indeed their hearts might ſink, and their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage might flag: But ſeeing God hath ingaged for my perſeverance in the faith, I will wreſtle with all my might, and uſe the utmoſt diligence; for it will not be in vain ſo to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thine heart: wait I ſay on the Lord.</hi> Hath God promiſed to preſerve you, then be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; follow hard after him, and urge him with his promiſe; and in his way you may expect the accompliſhment of it.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>firſt rule</hi> for vindication of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. <hi>The many counſels and warnings which Chriſt hath given to his people, to look well to themſelves, leſt they ſhould loſe their hold of him, and be ſeparated from him; are no proof at all that they may be ſeparated; or that their union with him may be diſſolved.</hi> God's injunctions upon them to keep themſelves, and his ingagement to be their keeper; do not interfere one with the other; but may well conſiſt and ſtand together. And the reaſon is evident, Becauſe theſe cautions an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is according to that <hi>Statute Law</hi> of the Lord of hoſts, <hi>That his Spirit ſhall go forth in his word, and with his word, Iſa.</hi> 59.21. Will ſome ſay? To what end doth God ſo

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64514:127"/>iniquity,</hi> whereby he was actually bound over to condemnation; ſo that the perſon juſtified may ſay, <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi> He may read over the moſt dreadful paſſages of the Law, without being terrified; as knowing the curſe is removed from over his head: his fins that brought him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe are forgiven; and are in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation as if they had never been. This is to be juſtified; to have ſin thus forgiven, and the penalty remitted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs. Even as</hi> David <hi>alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth righteouſneſs without works,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi> Mark it, what <hi>David</hi> calleth forgiveneſs of ſin and not imputing of iniquity, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles a being juſtified. This is expreſſed elſewhere by <hi>not remembring tranſgreſſions any more, Heb.</hi> 8.12. And there are <hi>three wayes</hi> how they ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred any more. (1.) God will not remember them, <hi>ſo as to upbraid his people with their miſcarriages:</hi> He will never hit them in the teeth with their ſins. When the wicked ſeek unto him in affliction, and howl for deliverance, God doth upbraid them with their wickedneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.27, 28. <hi>Where are thy Gods which thou hast made thee? Let them ariſe, if they can ſave thee in the time of trouble; q. d.</hi> Why do ye come to me, ſeeing you hate me, and caſt me off, and ſet up idols in your hearts? Get you to them for deliverance, for you are none of my ſervants. But when perſons are juſtified, their ſins ſhall be as if they had not been: God will welcom them into his houſe, and embrace them in his arms, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64514:127"/>throw it in their diſh, how unkind, or unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or ſtubborn they have been formerly. See it in the return of the <hi>Prodigal, Luke</hi> 15.20, 21, 22. <hi>When he was a great way off, his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran, and fell upon his neck and kiſſed him. And the ſon ſaid unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon. But the father ſaid unto his ſervants, bring forth the beſt robe and put it on him, and put a ring upon his hand, and ſhoes upon his feet.</hi> One would have thought, he would have fallen foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſaid, <hi>You are well enough ſerved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of my family: you ſee what it is to think your ſelf wiſer than your father: What account can you give me of the patrimony you received? Do you think I will give you entertainment, now you have ſpent your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with riotous living, and amongſt harlots? Go to your ſinful companions that have made a prey of you, and ſee what relief they will afford now in the day of your diſtreſs.</hi> But here is not a word of ſuch langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; But, <hi>welcome my dear ſon, he is a pleaſant child, my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him,</hi> Jer. 31.20. (2.)

I will not enter upon the debate of that queſtion, which ſome have ventilated, whether God in his abſolute ſoveraignty could not have forgiven ſin, meerly as an act of grace, without the ſinners producing any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to juſtice?

With what boldneſs may they come to the throne of grace, and beg what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they need, and be aſſured not to be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way empty? <hi>Now</hi> this bleſſed priviledge depends upon our union with Jeſus Chriſt: As it was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy purchaſed by his blood, ſo it is actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64514:132"/>upon thoſe that are in him. The Lord Jeſus is the natural, eternal, only begotten Son of God, who lieth in the boſom of the Father; and when we are married unto Chriſt, we become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God alſo; by vertue of our conjunction with his Son, and neerneſs of relation unto his Son, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of children, by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf.</hi> And if you enquire when this purpoſe is executed, and we actually become his children? The ſame Apoſtle will reſolve it, <hi>when we are in Chriſt.</hi> Predeſtination hath deſigned us unto this priviledge, and union with Chriſt doth inſtate us in it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>For ye are the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> by that grace which knitteth you unto Jeſus. This is a <hi>ſecond Argument</hi> of the neceſſity of having the Son: For <hi>no union with Chriſt, no adoption of children by him.</hi> Therefore the Lord is our Father becauſe Chriſt's Father, and our God becauſe his God, we being one with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third fundamental bleſſing,</hi> which I ſhall mention as flowing from oneneſs with Chriſt, and having a neceſſary dependance thereupon, is, <hi>The participation of the ſupplies of the Spirit of Jeſus,</hi> to guide us in our journey to the kingdom of heaven. As a ſinner muſt partake of regenerating grace from the Spirit, to put him in the way of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life; ſo he ſtands in need of the continued ſupplies of that good Spirit, to conduct and keep him in that way.

               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place you muſt remember, <hi>That a Chriſtian is not able to keep on in his journey towards heaven, ſo as to arrive with ſafety at that everlaſting Kingdom, only by the ſtrength of habitual grace beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him in his firſt converſion; but there muſt be a daily communication of further grace unto the ſoul, or of freſh actual ſtrength conveyed into the ſoul.</hi> It is not enough that the principles of holineſs be at firſt formed in the heart, but there muſt be a conſtant ſupply of freſh influence imparted to us, or elſe we ſhould quickly fall ſhort in our travel towards <hi>Canaan.</hi> As the air is not maintained in light, barely by the firſt riſing of the Sun upon it, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling darkneſs out of the air, &amp; ſpreading abroad his beams into it: but there muſt be a conſtant iſſuing forth of freſh beams from the Sun, and ſtreamings forth of new influence into the air: elſe it would quickly return to its former darkneſs.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> herein doth lie a ſpecial difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtate of man in his primitive perfection, under the Covenant of works, and the ſtate of believers under the Covenant of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: and indeed the excellency and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the latter, above the former. In the ſtate of innocency man had a ſufficient ſtock of holineſs, and ſpiritual power to manage: but now in Chriſt there is proviſion made for conſtant ſupplies, to carry us on in the management thereof. Under the Covenant of works man had <hi>power to ſtand, if he would:</hi> but in the Covenant of grace there is freſh ſtrength alſo provided, <hi>to work in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. There is not only a new heart, and a new ſpirit given to the ſervants of Chriſt, whereby they are qualified and diſpoſed to the keeping of God's ſtatutes: But a further actual ability is imparted unto them, whereby they are cauſed to walk in the way of thoſe Statutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From hence it many times cometh to paſs,</hi> that weak Chriſtians ſtand faſt in thoſe trials, wherein the ſtronger fall; and overcome the temptation, whereby <hi>they</hi> are foiled. Here you have a great reaſon of the difference, that is between one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever and another in the ſame caſe, and under the like trial.

This is palpably apparent in the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was a man of great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and courage in the cauſe of Chriſt: yet how ſhamefully did he deny his Maſter? Becauſe truſting in his own ſtrength, the Lord was pleaſed to withdraw his actual aſſiſtance, that he might learn thereafter to live in the ſenſe of his own weakneſs. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> fell in the buſineſs of the Embaſſadors of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> although he was a man of eminent piety: yet <hi>the Lord left him,</hi> and then corruption diſcovered it ſelf, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. <hi>How did God leave him?</hi> Not as to the principle of habitual grace; for that is an abiding principle, never taken from a perſon on whom it is once conferred: But <hi>God left him,</hi> as to theſe freſh ſupplies of the ſpirit; he with-held from him, for that time, ſuch efficacious aſſiſtance, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might have vanquiſhed the temptation: and then his deceitful heart prevailed and carried him aſide.</p>

               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>Exciting grace,</hi> whereby the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holineſs is awakened, and ſtirred up, and put into a readineſs unto that which is good. For although there are habits of grace alwayes reſident in the hearts of the godly, yet thoſe habits are not alwayes in a preſent aptneſs and preparedneſs unto the matters of godlineſs. What a liſtleſsneſs and heavineſs is oftentimes upon the heart of a ſincere Chriſtian? So that he hath grace to ſeek, when he is called to the exerciſe of it: he is not in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bring it forth into act. And therefore we have need frequently to quicken our hearts, and to awaken and ſtir up the grace of God that is within us. It was the complaint of the Lord againſt his people, that they did not <hi>ſtir up themſelves to take hold of him,</hi> Iſa. 64.7. There needeth exciting grace and aſſiſtance, to ſtir us up unto practical holineſs; that our loyns may be girt, and our lamps burning, and our ſelves <hi>[in procinctu]</hi> in a readineſs to every good work; as the exhortation is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. How much is <hi>David</hi> in prayer, that God would quicken him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy way,</hi> Pſal. 80.18. <hi>Quicken us, and we will call upon thy name,</hi> Pſal. 86.11. <hi>

Now this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing influence proceedeth from Chriſt, and is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth unto them that are ingraffed into him. It is he that knocketh at the door of the heart, to awaken believers out of their ſecurity; and to put them into a poſture, that they may be ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him whitherſoever he ſhall lead them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Co-operating grace,</hi> or aſſiſtance to do the will of God: whereby the new creature is ſet on work, and inabled to walk in the way of Gods commandments. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> herein lieth a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the principles of ſin, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſeated in the ſoul, and the habits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which in the new birth are introduced into the ſoul. The principles of ſin can work of themſelves, without any forreign aſſiſtance to reduce them into act. If there were no devil to tempt us unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, the corrupt heart of man would be a tempter to it ſelf, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. and would ruſh on into wickedneſs of its own accord: But the habits of grace cannot act of themſelves, there muſt be renewed ſtrength imparted to ſet them on work, which we may fitly call <hi>co-operating grace,</hi> Pſal. 119.35. <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for therein do I delight.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> had a ſpirit of new life within him, yet he could not actually walk in the path of God's precepts, till by an additional force he was ſet a going. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come thou South-wind, blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out.</hi> By the <hi>garden,</hi> underſtand a ſanctified ſoul; and by the <hi>ſpices</hi> in this garden may be meant the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And this co-operating aſſiſtance is in Chriſt, and iſſued forth unto them that are one with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Thon therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That is, Get aſſiſtance from him, out of his fulneſs, to ſtrengthen thee to the diſcharge of the work of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is <hi>reſiſting grace,</hi> to oppoſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto ſin, and to vanquiſh and overcome the aſſaults of the devil. Although in the firſt work of converſion there is a ſecret antipathy ſet up in the ſpirit againſt ſin; yet if you would be actually free from the taint of it, there muſt be <hi>further ſtrength</hi> to help you, in grapling with temptations unto ſin. And this alſo is in Chriſt, to be communicated unto his members, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. The Apoſtle doth exhort us to <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> Not to enter the liſts in our own ſtrength, but <hi>to put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devil.</hi> And the ſpiritual combate maintained by a child of God is called <hi>The fight of faith:</hi> becauſe ſin is eſpecially oppoſed by the exerciſe of faith, and the victory obtained through faith in Jeſus; by which, freſh ſupplies of ſtrength are fetcht down from him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth ſort of actual ſtrength is <hi>ſupporting grace,</hi> for the bearing ſuch burdens as are laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.

As you are called to ſuffer, ſo through the ſupplies of Chriſt's Spirit you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered and fortified thereunto.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Reſtoring grace,</hi> To recover us out of that deadneſs, into which we are apt to fall; and to call us back from thoſe decayes unto which believers are ſubject. For though habitual grace ſhall never be quite loſt, yet the vigour of it may be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated: in which reſpect a Believer may be ſaid <hi>to loſe his firſt love,</hi> Rev. 2.4. And though grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, yet in this ſenſe it may be ſaid <hi>to be ready to die,</hi> Rev. 3, 2. Now for the reſtoring of a mans ſoul to its former life and activity, and reviving upon the new man its ancient luſtre and beauty, there muſt be freſh ſtrength communicated. Which <hi>reviving ſtrength</hi> is ſtored up in the Son, and given forth to them that have the Son. It is by the freſh beams of the Sun of righteouſneſs, that the clouds are diſpelled, and the miſts are driven away; and the ſoul of a Chriſtian is made to <hi>look forth as the morning:</hi> according as it is expreſſed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is <hi>increaſing grace</hi> for augmentation of the principle of holineſs; that the new man may artive at his full growth and ſtature unto which he is appointed. And it is by grace which is in Jeſus
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64514:137"/>Chriſt the head, and by freſh influence out of his fulneſs, that the <hi>body maketh increaſe unto the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelf,</hi> Eph. 4.16.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> and <hi>confirming grace,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Believers are fixed and ſettled unto the end. And this likewiſe is from Chriſt, by vertue of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. It is <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt we are preſerved,</hi> Jude 1. <hi>Being rooted in him, we become establiſhed in the faith,</hi> Col. 2.7.</p>
               <p>So much for the <hi>third ſignal mercy</hi> or <hi>bleſſing</hi> which floweth from ingrafture into Chriſt, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance thereupon: namely, <hi>The communication of the ſupplies of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>fourth mercy</hi> that depends upon having the Son, or union with the Son, is, <hi>The gracious acceptation of all our ſervice and duties.</hi> Take an unconverted ſinner, and he may do many things in Religion; he may ſuffer much upon a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account, and be at much coſt and expence in his profeſſion and practiſe; And the God of heaven hath no regard unto it. Herein lieth the miſery of a man out of Chriſt, that whatſoever he doth for God, is not accepted of the Lord. He may make many prayers, and loſe all his labour therein: For the cars of the God of heaven are ſhut againſt them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>When you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when you make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers I will not hear.</hi> When you ſpread forth your hands] <hi>that is,</hi> Although you call upon me with never ſo much ſeeming earneſtneſs; although you ſeek after me in a ſolemn &amp; <hi>ſeemingly</hi> affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate maner, with your hands ſtretched out towards heaven: <hi>I will hide mine eyes from you</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And <hi>when you multiply to pray,</hi> I will be ſo far from granting your requeſts, that I will turn away my ſelf in diſdain from you: I will not ſo much as give you the hearing. O what a ſad word is this to the ungodly! They truſt in their duties, when the Lord abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them. See another Text ſetting forth their deplorable condition in this reſpect, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Put your burnt offerings unto your ſacrifices, and eat fleſh.</hi> It is unto the wicked he is ſpeaking, and it amounts to this. <hi>As if he had ſaid,</hi> Keep your duties to your ſelves, I will have nothing to do with them: make your beſt of your offerings, and never bring them unto me, as long as you live in your iniquities. Their burnt offerings, or <hi>Holocauſts,</hi> were wholly to be burnt; but as for their ſacrifices, the offerers themſelves might eat ſome part of them. Now <hi>ſaith God to thoſe impenitent ſinners,</hi> Take them and and eat them both; put them together, and uſe them your ſelves, make your beſt advantage of them, for I regard them not. <hi>Mark it,</hi> Theſe were coſtly duties, and in reſpect to their ſignification they were Evangelical duties: but whilſt they were ſtill in their ſins, God hath no delight in them. What courſe then ſhall a man take, that his ſacrifices may be accepted? <hi>Why,</hi> he muſt get into Chriſt, and be knit to him: for this is a mercy which floweth from union with him. Then, if he offer up his duties in the Name of Chriſt, the work is owned, and the concomitant infirmities will be paſſed over. <hi>Particularly,</hi> then his ſupplications and prayers ſhall be graciouſly anſwered: which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And for the general acceptance of all their duties of God's appointment, <hi>conſult the Text,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt; q. d.</hi> Then your performances will be accepted through him, when ye your ſelves are built upon him, and cemented unto him. Here is another proof of the indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity of this Union, <hi>No having the Son,</hi> and <hi>no acceptation of any duties whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Another bleſſing</hi> which floweth from union with Chriſt, and is attainable only thereby, is, <hi>A title to the promiſes of the Goſpel,</hi> which concern this life, or that which is to come. And this is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of unſpeakable concernment: for if you would enjoy the mercies conveyed by the promiſes, you muſt have an intereſt in the promiſes. You muſt ſecure a title to them, as your heritage, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then they will prove a rich treaſury, or magazine, to furniſh you with every thing needful for life, comfort, and happineſs. There can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſired for the advancement of a mans wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, which is not contained therein. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are the foundation on which our hope is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed; Indeed herein it differs from preſumption, which expects mercy from God, without a word of promiſe, to warrant the expectation thereof. But good hope <hi>through grace</hi> is built upon the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember the word unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64514:138"/>upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi> If a perſon entertain ſtrong hopes of mercy, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without a word for it, or againſt the word; that is hope of the devils cauſing: or ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the deluſion and cozenage of his own Spirit: it will prove ſuch an hope as will make him aſhamed at length; and will be like the giving up the Ghoſt. When God cauſeth a man to hope, it is built upon the word; <hi>that is,</hi> the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, whereby mercy is entailed upon the ſervants of the Lord. And, <hi>pray mark it Sirs,</hi> you can have no title to the promiſes, ſo as to reſt upon them, and to be able to plead them with God, and to lay hold upon them as your heritage, till you have the Son, and are knit unto Jeſus: For <hi>in him they are eſtabliſhed.</hi> They are part of the inheritance prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Saints; and unleſs a perſon be married to the heir, he can lay no juſt claim to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For in him all the promiſes of God are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi> And therefore the promiſe is ſaid to be given <hi>through faith in Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>that is,</hi> A title to the promiſe, or the enjoyment of the mercy promiſed, is made over to a ſinner by faith in Chriſt: by that uniting grace, which joyneth us unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>fifth ſpecial mercy</hi> depending upon union with the Son. Except you have the Son, the Mediator of the Covenant; you can have no right to the promiſes contained in the Covenant. <hi>Your title to them, doth reſult and flow from your oneneſs with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. There is <hi>Union with God the Father,</hi> and an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance with him. Whilſt out of Chriſt,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64514:139"/>we are at a diſtance from the Father: <hi>yea,</hi> at an enmity with him. He is a conſuming fire, and we are as ſo much bryars and thornes: and it were a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. But by having the Son, that diſtance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the enmity taken away, and we are knit unto God; ſo as to have fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. As Chriſt is in the Father, and the Father in him: ſo Believers by being in Chriſt, are in the Father alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they alſo may be one in us.</hi> Not only in Jeſus the Mediator, but in the Father likewiſe, by means of their being in Jeſus. So 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Unto the Church of the</hi> Theſſalonians, <hi>which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It was the end of Chriſt's ſufferings in the fleſh, that he might bring ſinners unto God; and by vertue of their union with the Son they are actually brought unto him, and knit unto the Father alſo. O what a wonderful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement is this, to ſinful duſt and aſhes! To poor deſpicable creatures, that dwell in houſes of clay! With what aſtoniſhment ſhould it fill us? What a ſpring-head of all manner of conſolation is here? Who would not be a Chriſtian? <hi>not only almoſt, but altogether?</hi> Who would not have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and hold a correſpondency with the Saints? For <hi>truly their fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth it by way of gloriation and boaſting, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>ſixth fundamental bleſſing.</hi> By having the Son, they have the Father alſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Believers union with Chriſt, is the ground of all that <hi>peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which putteth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64514:139"/>true gladneſs into the heart, and life and ſweetneſs into every condition, and providence. The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin are poor, empty, external pleaſures: In the midſt of laughter, the heart is in bitterneſs: they have many a ſecret griping of conſcience, that ſpoileth their mirth; and many a fearful ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal upon their ſpirits, that marreth all their jollity. Let them be ſet in the midſt of their riotings and revellings, their banquettings and carowſings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the content and pleaſure that ſin and the world can afford: and one ſerious thought of judgment to come, will overturn it wholly: one flaſh of hell in the conſcience, will put an end to their rejoycings. It will quickly befal them as it befel <hi>Belſhazzar;</hi> The appearance but of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a mans fingers upon the wall, made his <hi>countenance change,</hi> and his <hi>thoughts trouble him,</hi> and <hi>the joints of his loyns to be looſed,</hi> and <hi>his knees to ſmite one againſt another:</hi> and that, when he was in the top of his gallantry, and in the height of his merriment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5, 6. O, <hi>thinks the poor carnal wretch,</hi> what will become of my precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul? Can all theſe enjoyments deliver me from the pit of deſtruction? <hi>Who can dwell with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting burnings? Iſa.</hi> 33.14. But the people of God have ſuch peace as paſſeth underſtanding: ſuch a ſweet calm and tranquillity in their ſpirits, that they can rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, even in the midſt of afflictions. The joy of the ungodly is worſe than ſorrow: It is but a fit of madneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ignorance of the ſtate they are in. If they knew but their own condition, it would fill them with vexation, and horror and anguiſh of heart: But <hi>great peace</hi> have they that fear the Lord
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64514:140"/>and are in Covenant with him,

And, <hi>pray,</hi> whence doth this peace ariſe? <hi>Why,</hi> originally from their union with Chriſt: All peace out of him will end in ſadneſs: it is but as the crackling of thornes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pot. In him our conſolation is ſtored up, and given forth by vertue of our conjunction with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that in me ye might have peace.</hi> If any of the children of God are under diſquietneſs and perplexities upon their ſpirits, it is for want of the evidences of their union with Chriſt; or through their neglect of the right improvement thereof. For here is a fountain to fill up a Believers joy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that my joy might remain with you, and that your joy might be full.</hi> What were thoſe things which Chriſt had ſpoken to them? It was the doctrine of a Believers ingrafture into him, and abiding in him; and the conſequents and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants thereof: in the ſormer part of that Chap. So that, <hi>no union with Chriſt, no ſolid peace or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ſoul;</hi> no true joy in the Spirit: For all manner of conſolation and revivings from him, depend upon our oneneſs with him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is a believers union with the Lord Jeſus, which giveth him <hi>deliverance from the ſting and curſe of death: and conſequentially, from the fear of that king of terrors.</hi> It is this conjunction with the Son, which maketh the laſt change, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64514:140"/>and happy exchange, that altereth the nature of death, from a curſe into a bleſſing. So that a Chriſtian is able to bid it welcome, and to look it in the face with boldneſs: it being diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as far as it is an enemy, and having the venom and malignity taken out of it. This is a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and unvaluable mercy: For it is the fear of death which keepeth ſinners all their life time, in bondage; and puts a kind of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enjoyment. O death, how bitter is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thee to a man that is at eaſe? to every impenitent ſinner? There is a terribleneſs to the unregenerate, in the apprehenſions of death, upon every account: But <hi>as it is the paſſage unto eternity,</hi> it is the greateſt of terrors, <hi>Job</hi> 18.14. <hi>Mark it,</hi> I ſay, there is a dread in the thoughts of it every way. Death may be conſidered in a <hi>threefold reſpect.</hi> 1. As it is a <hi>diſſolution,</hi> between the ſoul and the body: as it parts and ſeparates thoſe ancient friends, which have long converſed intimately together. And thus it ſtartleth a ſinner, to think of leaving his old habitation, having no better provided in the ſtead of it: But a Believer can triumph in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> 2. If you conſider it as it is a <hi>period,</hi> and puts an end to all worldly accommodations; ſo it cannot but perplex a ſinner. The place of his habitation ſhall know him no more: he ſhall be then ſtripped and diveſted of whatever earthly comforts have been dear unto him: His heart is glewed unto the world, and what anguiſh and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs muſt it needs create, to think of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from all? But now a child of God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64514:141"/>to counterballance this loſs, <hi>even a better, and far more enduring ſubſtance, Heb.</hi> 10.34. 3. As death is <hi>a paſſage unto eternity,</hi> ſo it is dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. O <hi>thinks the ſinner,</hi> what will become of my ſoul for ever? When I go hence and be no more upon the Land of the living, into what chains of darkneſs, what an eternal priſon muſt I be ſent, amongſt devils and damned ſpirits? But a ſincere Chriſtian can cheerfully welcom it, under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration alſo. He knoweth it is but a meſſenger ſent from his heavenly Father, to conduct him home to his manſion place; and to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to neerer fellowſhip with his Redeemer. It puts an end to all ſin, and temptations, and troubles of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort; and opens a door of entrance into unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joyes that ſhall never end. O <hi>Sirs,</hi> what a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is this to be able to triumph over death? It is that unto which we are ſubject every moment:

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond great <hi>ſimilitude</hi> which the Spirit of God hath made uſe of, for the elucidation and ſetting forth of this Myſtery of a Believers oneneſs with Chriſt, is taken <hi>from that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which is betwixt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64514:146"/>the vine, and the branches graffed into the vine.</hi> Or betwixt the root or ſtock, and the ſience inſerted into the ſtock. Believers are trees of righteouſneſs in God's vineyard, but they do not grow upon their own root: The Lord Jeſus is the root, whence all their ſap is derived. An hypocrite bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf, and he groweth upon his own root; If he have any adhaerance to Chriſt, it is but external: But now a Saint indeed is graffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and there is a coaleſcency betwixt them into one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>I am the vine, ye are the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, This is the compariſon wherewith I may fitly compare my neer relation to you my Diſciples, and ſuch as you are.</p>
               <p>I have had occaſion already to touch upon this ſimilitude, and therefore at preſent I will but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs over theſe <hi>four things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the whole dependance of Chriſtians, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect, as to the matters appertaining to life and godlineſs, is upon the Lord Jeſus: and they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt one moment without him.</hi> If they have ſpiritual life &amp; Saintſhip, it is from Chriſt: if they are upheld and maintained in that eſtate, it is by Chriſt: and if they have ſtrength and ability to work the works of God, it is imparted through him: For they are branches in him, and he is the vine. So that we have no cauſe to boaſt of our ſelves, nor is there any ground for ſelf-confidence, or truſting in our ſelves: But the whole life that we live, ſhould be by faith on the Son of God. All our freſh ſprings are in him. Separate the branches from the vine, and they quickly decay and periſh, and are fit for nothing but the fire: ſo doth the ſoul of a man or
<pb facs="tcp:64514:147"/>woman, if ſeparated from Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18. <hi>If thou boaſteſt: thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.</hi> Let this, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> keep down the pride of your hearts, do not glory in your ſelves; for you have nothing from thence. If a man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſet him glory in the Lord: for all the ſap and juice cometh from the root. The branch hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its own, but what is received from thence. All your ſupport is by vertue of the root; ſo that walk humbly with God, in the ſenſe of your own emptineſs, and utter inſufficiency. And if you would live the life of God indeed, have your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant recourſe unto the Lord Jeſus, and be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nouriſhment from him: <hi>for thou ſtandeſt by faith,</hi> Rom. 11.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſimilitude imports, <hi>That the union of a Believer with the Lord Jeſus, is a very cloſly compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and intimate union:</hi> that they are very firmly, and entirely, knit together. The branch, when it is graffed, becometh thereby incorporated into the vine: ſo in a ſpiritual ſenſe, there is a kind of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation</hi> of Chriſt and his people together; and therefore it is repreſented under the notion of being graffed into him. There is a deep and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them: ſo deep and intimate, that they are called by his Name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that one body, being many, are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt; i. e.</hi> ſo is the company of Believers <hi>[Chriſt myſtical]</hi> who are ſo knit cloſs unto Chriſt, as if they were the ſame; as if they were conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated into one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From this reſemblance we may obſerve, <hi>That a perſon cannot poſſibly be united unto Jeſus, till he be taken off from all other dependances whatſoever,</hi> Firſt
<pb facs="tcp:64514:147"/>there muſt be a cutting on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſtock in which it naturally groweth, before it can be graffed into another. Firſt there muſt be an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſion,</hi> before there can be an <hi>inſition.</hi> A branch may grow neer to the vine, without being cut off from its old root: but it muſt be wholly cut off, ere it can be graffed into the vine. <hi>Sirs,</hi> By nature we grow in the wild olive tree, we are rooted in the old <hi>Adam, ſin and ſelf:</hi> for when men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> preſently they have recourſe unto <hi>ſelf,</hi> as a Saviour to deliver them from their ſins. But if you would get into Chriſt, you muſt be taken off from theſe: As you have it in the continued metaphor, or allegory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. <hi>For if thou wert cut off out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree.</hi> Mark it, firſt cut off from the one, before ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being graffed into the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Learn in the laſt place from this ſimilitude, <hi>That the glory and excellency of a Chriſtian doth lie in practical holineſs,</hi> or <hi>in being fruitful and abundant in the work of the Lord.</hi> You know, The worth and excellency of a branch doth not conſiſt in its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful outſide, or in the fair leaves and bloſſoms which it may bear: but in bringing forth much fruit. When there are fair cluſters of grapes hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, this doth content the Husbandman, and prevents the pruning-hooks cutting off ſuch a branch for the fire. So herein is the excellency of a Believer, when he is active for God in his place and calling, and filled with the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: This is acceptable unto God, and well pleaſing in his ſight. This commends the root as a juicy, ſappy root, when the branches are fruitful, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Fathor glorified, that ye bear</hi>

This is the <hi>ſecond reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third ſimilitude</hi> ſetting forth the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Believer to Chriſt, is drawn from the <hi>

                     </gap>uptial conjunction which is betwixt the husband and wife.</hi> Chriſt and his people are joyned together in a conjugal union: He is married unto them, and they are his Spouſe whom he hath betrothed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. When a man and woman are joyned in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, according to the Inſtitution and Ordinance of God, they become one fleſh: ſo the Lord Chriſt and true Believers are one ſpirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.31, 32. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and mother, and ſhall be joyned to his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> It is as much as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſaid, If the husband and wife are one, by vertue of their marriage-covenant, or nuptial contract; much more intimately are Chriſt and his people one, by their ſpiritual marriage: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is but a ſhadow of this Union.

And the truth is <hi>Sirs,</hi> that bare promiſes for the future, are ſo far from uniting us to the Son, that they are nothing elſe but the ſly endeavours of the heart, to put a cheat upon Chriſt. It is by ſuch hypocritical promiſes, that when ſinners are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the neceſſity of cloſing with Chriſt, they do break through ſuch convictions; and get from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of them. When conſcience preſſeth them hard, this is the anſwer whereby they ſtop
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64514:151"/>the mouth of conſcience; <hi>hereafter</hi> they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient to the Goſpel. But be not deceived, Chriſt will not be dallyed with, but all perſons ſhall know that <hi>he ſearcheth the hearts and the reins,</hi> and is able to ſee through their diſſimulation and hypocriſie, <hi>and he will give to every one according to their works,</hi> Rev. 2.23.</p>

Such <hi>caveats,</hi> and <hi>proviſo's</hi> they enter into; but this leaveth them ſtill in ſubjection to the devil. For that acceptance and conſent which uniteth a ſinner unto Chriſt, muſt be a marriage-conſent; when we take him wholly and entirely without any acceptions, to ſubmit to him in all his inſtitutions and commandments, and to cleave to him in all eſtates and conditions. When we take Chriſt for our Lord and Husband, <hi>to have and to hold, for better and for worſe, for richer and for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health,</hi> to go with him through fire and water, reſolving through grace, that nothing ſhall divide betwixt us, and that we

Thus Chriſt is the foundation, and every Saint is a ſtone in the building founded upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Behold I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>for a foundation, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation.</hi> Which the holy Ghoſt expoundeth, once and again, as meant of Jeſus Chriſt. And it is an excellent paſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining abundant matter of incouragement for humbled ſinners, to come unto Chriſt, and to reſt upon him. 1. He is a Saviour of Gods appointment, ſufficiently authorized to be the Mediator; ſo that if you come to God by him, he will not reject
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64514:154"/>you; for it is the Lord's doing to conſtitute him to be our Redeemer; it is the way which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſet open to bring ſinners to ſalvation, He is the foundation which the Lord hath laid. <hi>I lay in Sion for a foundation.</hi> 2. For the qualification of his perſon, he is mighty to ſave, able to deliver to the uttermoſt: He is not as ſand or gravel, by which the building cannot be ſupported; but a <hi>ſtone,</hi> or rock, which noteth the ſtability and ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt; he is able to bear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weight is laid upon him. No winds, or ſtorms from earth, or hell, can prevail to overturn what is built upon him. And this ariſeth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his perſon; being very God, as well as man. 3. <hi>He is a tryed ſtone.</hi> Do you yet queſtion his ſufficiency to ſave you? Are you ſtill in doubt whether you may truſt in him? <hi>Why,</hi> do but mind the experience which he hath given of his ability, he is a tryed ſtone: <hi>Eve</hi> hath tryed him, and <hi>Enoch</hi> tryed him, and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and all the people of God in former ages have made the experiment; and their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations were not fruſtrated: they found him ſuch a one as he is diſcovered to be; He is <hi>a ſtone of trial,</hi> a foundation of proof, <hi>a ſure foundation.</hi> 4. This is that which God would have ſinners to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, <hi>Behold</hi> I lay in <hi>Sion</hi> for a foundation a ſtone, &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> Hear, O people, and give ear all ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, mind what I have done to carry on the ſalvation of ſinners. And to what end is this publication made, but that we might come unto Chriſt, and unto God by him with full aſſurance of faith? This is the <hi>firſt particular</hi> I would obſerve under this ſimilitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This reſemblance doth import, <hi>That all ſuch

As the foundation is the ſupporter of the building, ſo it is a rule and meaſure unto the building. The ſtones which are ſet upon it muſt be proportioned thereunto: the ſuperſtructure muſt be of length, and breadth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foundation. So it is in the ſpiritual building. The ſouls of Believers, who are joyned to Chriſt, muſt bear a proportion to him with whom they are joyned. This is the Statute-Law of the God of heaven, and it is more unalterable, and irrevocable, than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> That there is no ſaving intereſt in Chriſt without conformity to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.</hi> Mark, It is the unchangable decree of the Lord of Hoſts; If you are ſaved in any other way, or at a cheaper rate, it muſt be by the alteration of God's decrees; which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, as his nature and eſſence, <hi>without any variableneſs or ſhadow of turning.</hi> As Chriſt could never have been our Redeemer, but he muſt be made like unto us: ſo we ſhall never taſte of the Redemption purchaſed by him, unleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5.

If we will be faithful unto Chriſt, we muſt look to meet with the like uſage as he met with; and to go through many tribulations, into the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>ſecond thing</hi> to be noted under this compariſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to the purport and tenour of this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64514:156"/>ſimilitude, taken from the foundation and the building; <hi>Our faith, which is the uniting grace, is a reſting upon Chriſt and his righteouſneſs.</hi> The ſtones are joyned to the foundation by being laid upon it, and there reſting: So when we lay the ſtreſs of our ſalvation upon Chriſt, and caſt our burden upon him, and there ſtay our ſelves, as upon a rock; thereby we are united unto Jeſus, and made one with him. By nature we are as rough, unpoliſhed ſtones in a quarry, without any relation to Chriſt. Now the work of conviction, may be compared to the <hi>unſettling of theſe ſtones;</hi> and humiliation and legal terrors upon the heart, are <hi>the hewing of theſe ſtones;</hi> By the firſt they are removed out of the Quarry, and by the other their ruggedneſs is pared away: The grace of converſion is as the fitting, and <hi>poliſhing the ſtones for the building;</hi> and faith is <hi>a putting them upon the foundation,</hi> and their reſting upon it. As by the cement of love, the ſtones are coupled one to another; ſo by faith they are knit unto the foundation. By the Spirit they are brought unto Chriſt, and ſo ſtay upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, and walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light? Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> Rom. 9.33. <hi>Behold I lay in</hi> Sion. <hi>ſtumbling stone, and rock of offence, and whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be confounded.</hi> Mark it, As Chriſt is a foundation to his people, ſo he is a rock of offence to them that are diſobedient; they ſplit themſelves againſt this rock, they ſtumble and fall and are broken in pieces. If you would be ſaved by him, you muſt by faith reſt upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: <hi>For whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not be confounded.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.4, 5. <hi>To whom coming as unto a

                  <hi>Better is a poor and a wiſe child, than an old and fooliſh King, who will no more be admoniſhed.</hi> Here are perſons put in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, that upon an outward account, are at as great a diſtance as is lightly imaginable. What is a poor man that gets his living from hand to mouth, in compariſon with a King, that ruleth over Cities and Countreys, that hath great attendants follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, multitudes of ſubjects at his beck and command, and millions of gold and ſilver heaped up in his treaſury? If the poor man ſhould come to his gates, he would hardly find entrance: he might dance attendance for many dayes, before he might be admitted to ſee the King: Poſſibly he might never get the priviledge, as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to kiſs his hand, and fall down at his feet. <hi>Yea,</hi> but if this poor perſon be <hi>in his childhood,</hi> which is an age contemptible of it ſelf, and having poverty added to it, is rendred more contemptible: and the King be <hi>an old one,</hi> who hath long ſate at the ſtern, and enjoyed the Soveraignty; and poſſibly is grown famous by glorious exploits; and hath heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up treaſures as the duſt, and ſettled his throne upon the beſt ſecurity, which the world can afford; that he thinks it can never be moved: you would think ſuch a poor child would not weigh a feather, if laid in the ballance with this mighty Prince, and Emperor. But I tell you <hi>ſaith Solomon,</hi> if this poor child have ſaving grace in his heart (for that is true wiſdom:) and the King be fooliſh, if he be a wicked man, an enemy to godlineſs, a ſtranger to the life of Religion (for ſuch an one is <hi>Solomons</hi> fool:) the poor child is to be preſerred before him: He is a more noble perſon than the old and fooliſh
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64514:158"/>King. And here is the reaſon of it; The poor child is united to Chriſt, and a friend of God through Chriſt; whilſt that old King is a ſlave of the devil.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, there is utterly a fault amongſt the generality of Profeſſors at this day; that they put a value upon men, according to their worldly greatneſs only; and the poor amongſt the godly are deſpiſed. As all that are upright in heart are commonly ſlighted, and trampled upon by the wicked; ſo the meaner ſort of them are not duly regarded, by the people of God themſelves. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed they are of the number of the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, being neereſt to the fountain of honour. So that we ought to have a ſpecial reſpect for the godly, be they never ſo low in the world: Our delight ſhould be in them, and our great ambition to be amongſt them. <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>companion of all them that feared the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 119.63. and all his delight was in the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. They are the moſt excellent perſons, deſerving our chiefeſt eſtimation.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>five things,</hi> from whence <hi>for the moſt part</hi> men are highly eſteemed; and as to each of them the Saints have the preheminence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt and pooreſt ground of our high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of men, is <hi>by their garments, wherewith they are clothed.</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> noted it as a corruption in his time, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.2, 3. If a man came with a gold ring, and in goodly apparel, and a poor man in vile rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they were apt to have reſpect to him that was in gay clothing, and to deſpiſe the other: And this corruption is hardly rooted out of mens ſpirits.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64514:158"/>in the places where they dwell. Is the rich man clothed with purple and ſcarlet? Well, but <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> hath on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. A wicked man may be adorned with gold and ſilver, but a Believer hath the ornaments of faith, and patience, and meekneſs, and temperance, and other excellent graces, which are in the ſight of God of great price. All that a wicked man hath on, are but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his ſhame, and meer rags and patches, which will not cover his nakedneſs:

               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> Here is the reaſon of it; they are in Chriſt, &amp; brought nigh unto God through Chriſt, and no marvel that he hath a principle regard unto ſuch.</p>
               <p>You know, <hi>That</hi> is a common diſtinction, and it is a very comfortable diſtinction, whereby the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is branched forth. 1. Into <hi>his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral providence</hi> over all creatures: So he feedeth the young ravens when they cry, and provideth meat for the beaſts of the field: he diſpoſeth and ordereth whatſoever doth concern any of the work of his hands. 2. <hi>His ſpecial providence</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own people, he hath a ſpecial eye upon them, and reſpect unto them. As it is with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the City or Countrey, If he be faithful in his place; he hath a regard to the affairs and government of all that are under his juriſdiction: but he hath a more than ordinary regard unto his own family, and houſhold. So the Lord is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mindful of the godly; and here is the ground of it, They are his family, united to his Son, and ſo his children by vertue of that union. We have this diſtinction, and the reaſon of it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26, 30. <hi>Behold the fowls of the air; for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly father feedeth them: Are not ye much better than they? Wherefore if God ſo clothe the graſs of the field, which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64514:162"/>to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven; ſhall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</hi> Mark it, If he mind other creatures, he will much more regard his people. How doth that appear? <hi>Why,</hi> becauſe they are his children, married to his Son: He is a <hi>Creator</hi> unto others, but he is a <hi>Father</hi> to them. He that feedeth the fowls of the Air (ſaith Chriſt) is your heavenly father. And therefore doubt not but he will exerciſe a peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over you.</p>
               <p>Wherein doth this peculiarity of the providence of God manifeſt it ſelf towards them? For <hi>anſwer,</hi> I will take notice of it in <hi>four things,</hi> beſides what hath been ſpoken of the peculiar Covenant-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which are conferred upon ſuch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth appear, <hi>in the ſpecial cognizance he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of their condition, and concernments.</hi> When the Lord looketh down from heaven upon all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth, and taketh a view of the tranſactions in the world; he doth it to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he may manage them in a compliance with the welfare of his children, and make them ſubſervient to their good. He maketh an exact enquiry into the ſtate of his Saints, and obſerveth other things to this very end, that they may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of to their advantage, and benefit. <hi>That</hi> is a precious Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro, throughout the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi> He maketh an inſpection into all the world, that he may not miſs any occaſion of doing good to his little flock: but may take all manner of advantages, to ſhew kindneſs to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This peculiarity of providence doth appear,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64514:162"/>
                  <hi>in the ſpecial ſupport which he miniſters unto the ſpirits of his people,</hi> to bear up their hearts; under ſuch preſſures, wherewith others are over whelmed. For although there is no viſible difference alwayes made in the acts of providence towards the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but it happens unto them according to the works of the wicked: Yet there is a remarkable difference to be obſerved, by a diſcerning ſpirit, in the ſupport which is miniſtred unto their hearts. When the wicked are at their wits end, and filled with terror on every ſide; then Believers can lift up their heads with confidence, and not be troubled at any amazement. God is graciouſly pleaſed, to ſend them <hi>love-tokens</hi> at every turn; to be a relief unto them, which the world knoweth not of: So that they can ſing with joy of heart, under thoſe very diſpenſations, when the wicked cry for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart, and howl for vexation of ſpirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.13, 14. Do but obſerve their confidence in the midſt of troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.2. <hi>We will not fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea;</hi> that is, though all things be in commotion, and combuſtion on every ſide: Our hearts are ſettled under the moſt ſhaking providences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It doth eminently appear, <hi>in Gods overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, that ſtand in the way of the welfare of his people,</hi> and prove hindrances to the advancement thereof. <hi>Sirs,</hi> The Lord will have no regard to thouſands of others, that ſtand in the way of the good of one of his choſen. He will overturn the thrones of the greateſt Emperors, if they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to the good of the meaneſt of his Saints. So that it is a dangerous thing to reſiſt the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the moſt high, when he awaketh to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64514:163"/>of them that are upright in heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3, 4. <hi>I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thy ranſom,</hi> Ethiopia <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>for thee. Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hinc generalis doctrina colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda eſt. Sic Domino curae eſſe pios omnes, ut pluris ipſos quam univerſum orbem faciat. Et nullum fore hominem, quem non tellat atque perimat Dominus, ut ſuos conſervet.</hi> Calv. in loc.</note> Rather than loſe but one of thoſe who are in Chriſt, he will deſtroy, and pluck up whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before him. <hi>He will ſtrike through kings in the day of his wrath, and wound the heads over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countreys,</hi> Pſal. 110.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The peculiarity of providence doth appear in this, <hi>That many outward enjoyments are given to the ungodly, and they are ſet on high for Believers ſakes.</hi> Not that God hath delight in the wicked, or is a countenancer of their evil wayes: but therefore he doth proſper and advance them, becauſe he intends to uſe them for the good of his Servants. Either to exerciſe their faith and patience, and to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their droſs; or <hi>ſometimes</hi> to ſhelter them from the rage of others. It was for <hi>Jacob's</hi> ſake that corn was laid up in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 45.7. It was for <hi>Iſrael's</hi> ſake that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was advanced to the Empire, and the treaſures of darkneſs given to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.3, 4. Your great Stateſmen little think of this: Their deſign is, by the advancement of perſons, to make their party ſtrong, or to pleaſe a friend, or to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their ſecular intereſt, one way or other: But God over-ruleth all for his peoples ſake: Unto whom he hath a peculiar regard in all things, that are brought to paſs under the Sun. And <hi>no marvel,</hi> for they are in Chriſt, married unto him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accordingly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64514:163"/>God hath a reſpect unto them. This is the <hi>ſecond Inference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt Inference, which I mainly intended to inlarge upon, is this: If there be an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity of Union with the Son, in order to the partaking of life through him, <hi>Then the ſtate of all unconverted ſinners whatſoever, before they are knit unto Chriſt by the ſpirit of regeneration taking hold on their perſons, and working faith in them to take hold on the Lord Jeſus, is a dead eſtate.</hi> For till they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into the Son, they can have no life from him. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life; i. e.</hi> he is ſtark dead, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead.</p>
               <p>This is one of the expreſſions, which the holy Ghoſt hath ſingled out, to ſet forth the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery of a perſon in the ſtate of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy, before he is brought unto Chriſt. He is not only defiled with ſin, but <hi>dead in ſin.</hi> Not only in a condition like that of the man that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thieves, in his journey from <hi>Jeruſalem to Jericho, Luk.</hi> 10.30. (as ſome would bear us in hand) who wounded him and left him half dead: But he is quite dead, without any ſpark of ſpiritual life remaining in him. By our Apoſtacy we brought our ſelves into a dead condition;
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Propheta dicit,</hi> Anima quae peccat ipſa morietur. <hi>Quamvis mortem ejus non ad interitum ſubſtantiae ſentiamus: Sed hoc ipſum, quia aliena &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torris ſit à Deo qui vera vita eſt, mors ei eſſe credenda eſt.</hi> Orig.</note> and till we are united to Chriſt, we are unavoidably ſhut up in that condition. The Son is the fountain of life unto loſt ſinners, and there is no reception of life from the Son, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the Son. And therefore the converſion of a ſinner is not as the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64514:164"/>of a ſick man</hi> out of his diſtemper, but as the <hi>raiſing of a dead man</hi> out of the grave, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24, 25.

My brethren, <hi>When a godly man dieth, he ſhall live:</hi> that is, when his body is dead, his ſoul ſhall live in the preſence of Chriſt, and ſee the face of God in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but <hi>an unregenerate perſon, whilſt he liveth, is dead:</hi> that is, whilſt he liveth the life of nature, and the life of ſenſe, and the life of reaſon, he is dead ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe he is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Chriſt who is the fountain of life.

               <p n="1">1. The ſtate of all Chriſtleſs unconverted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is a ſtate of death, <hi>in point of loathſomneſs and abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> You know that dead carkaſſes are loathſom unto the living: though a perſon hath been never ſo neer and dear to us, yet when they are dead we cannot endure their preſence. <hi>Let me bury my dead,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham, out of my ſight.</hi> Thus the unregenerate are dead: God loaths and abhorreth them, and all that is done by them. They are as ſmoak in his noſtrils, as dead ſtinking carrion in his ſight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.32. <hi>For the froward is an abomination to the Lord: but his ſecret is with the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>froward,</hi> underſtand the wicked of all ſorts; for they are oppoſed to the righteous: And indeed every ungodly man is perverſe and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his wayes: He riſeth up againſt the light of his own conſcience, and reſiſteth the workings of the Spirit, and is ready to rebel againſt the plain counſels of the word. He is a <hi>prating fool</hi> (as he is elſwhere called) his heart is finding fault with this command, and cavilling at the other duty: in all things he walketh croſs to God and holineſs, and delighteth in crooked paths. Let the Lord ſay what he will, he hath ſome objections againſt it, and is reſolved to hold on his own courſe: and therefore is juſtly called <hi>froward.</hi> And what is the condition of ſuch? why, they are an abomination to the Lord. I pray think of this, you that live in any way of ſin; you that harbour any ſecret luſt in your boſoms, and hide it as a ſweet morſel under your tongues, and thereby evidence that you are not in Chriſt. Remember, <hi>I ſay,</hi> though you may be rich and great, and men may flatter you: yet God abhorreth, and deteſteth you. You may have
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64514:165"/>high conceits of your ſelves, but you are a burden to the Spirit of the living God: and if you go on in thoſe wayes, he will quickly eaſe himſelf of you. <hi>For he hateth all the workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 5.5. O <hi>Sirs,</hi> How ſhould men haſten their eſcape out of this ſad eſtate? and adore the patience that hath hitherto ſpared them? and the infinite goodneſs of that God, who ſtill waiteth that he may ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto them? Certainly it is wonderful long-ſuffering, and powerful patience, whereby the wrath of God is reſtrained, from taking vengeance upon ſuch, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perſons unregenerate and out of Chriſt are dead, <hi>in reſpect of the putrefaction and rottenneſs of their condition.</hi> A dead carkaſs, the longer it lieth, the more it putrefies, and is corrupted: ſo it is with impenitent ſinners, The longer they lye in their unconverted eſtate, the worſe they grow; the more their ſpirits are ſetled in hatred againſt God, and the greater is their forwardneſs and proneneſs to all ſorts of abominations. And therefore none are ſo hard to be wrought upon as old ſinners; that have ſpent the moſt part of their time in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the devil, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Evil men and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers wax worſe and worſe.</hi> For cuſtom in ſin doth naturally tend to ſtrengthen the habits of ſin.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64514:165"/>proviſion for the fleſh, and to find out wayes to ſatisfie his luſts, and evaſions to break through convictions upon his conſcience: the more handy he groweth to commit any ſort of wickedneſs; ſo that in proceſs of time he will turn a deaf ear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to counſel.

For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſome workings of a natural conſcience might put a ſtop to mens running to all exceſs of riot: but when the bridle is broken, whither will not a wicked man run? So that my brethren, it is a point of wiſdom to ſeek unto God betimes: and for perſons that are in their youth, to remember their Creator in the morning of their lives. We are apt to cozen our ſelves by promiſes to repent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; when I have a convenient ſeaſon <hi>(ſaith the ſinner)</hi> I will make my peace with God; and when I am in a better temper.

So that <hi>deliver thy ſelf as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the ſnare of the fowler: Give not

               <p n="3">3. Perſons out of Chriſt are in a dead condition, <hi>in reſpect of their impotency, and inability to that which is ſpiritually good.</hi> A dead perſon hath no power to perform the works of nature, as eating, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and walking, and diſcourſing, and the like; becauſe he is dead. Thus impenitent ſinners are without ſtrength unto the things of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. A ſincere Chriſtian is <hi>dead to ſin:</hi> and the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>are dead in ſin;</hi> they have no power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the works of holineſs and righteouſneſs. In this ſenſe I principally underſtand that place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Even when we were dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, he hath quickned us;</hi> that is, When all our ſpiritual abilities were gone; If we had been left to our ſelves, we ſhould never have recovered out of our bondage and ſlavery, but muſt have lain in it eternally, without hopes of being delivered; and then God came and breathed the Spirit of life into us. And <hi>Sirs,</hi> this ſhould awaken us to cry mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the Lord, and never to give him reſt till he ſteppeth in for our recovery. This ſhould cauſe us to take diligent heed, that we quench not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, nor provoke him to withdraw his workings from us: for if he wholly depart, we are undone irremediably. I might under this head deſcend unto particulars, by ſhewing you. 1. That unconverted ſinners have no power <hi>to turn their ſouls unto God,</hi> nor to make a ſaving change upon their own ſpirits, but this I have touched upon before. 2. That they are without power <hi>to walk in the wayes of holineſs,</hi> or to perform one good action in an acceptable manner. When the Lord himſelf took a view of all mankind in their apoſtatized condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64514:166"/>he found <hi>not one that did good, no not one,</hi> Pſal. 14.2, 3. And 3. That they are without ſtrength <hi>to reſiſt the temptations of the devil,</hi> further than they are kept in by the reſtraining grace of God. Satan leadeth them captive <hi>as he will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. As the heart of man is tainted with the principles of the moſt horrid abominations, that ever were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Scriptures; ſo if God did not ſet bounds to the luſts that are within us, we ſhould quickly ruſh into the practiſe of them. <hi>Sirs,</hi> were it not for the reſtraining grace of the Almighty, you would have been murderers as <hi>Cain,</hi> and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of witchcraft as <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and have been as groſs Idolaters as any of the <hi>Heathen.</hi> Nay, you would have ſinned your ſelves before this time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, or without the compaſs of the promiſe of mercy and forgiveneſs. Surely this is not a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein a perſon ſhould quietly reſt one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for if God ſhould pluck up the flood-gates, whither would not the violent torrent of a mans corruptions carry him? <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I might have ſhewed you, 4. That the unregenerate are ſo far from having any power by nature to turn themſelves unto God, or to ſerve him in truth and ſincerity; <hi>that their hearts are filled with enmity and hatred againſt God, and his wayes;</hi> and ready to fight againſt the means appointed to draw them heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Nay, the <hi>carnal mind is enmity</hi> it ſelf, ſo it is expreſſed <hi>in the abſtract, Rom.</hi> 8.7. As if they were made up of nothing but venom, and poyſon, and wrath, and bitterneſs againſt God. <hi>But I muſt not dwell upon theſe things.</hi> The Lord preſs them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts, and awaken you to follow hard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and to take faſt hold of him, and never to let him go, till he hath given you clear evidence of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64514:167"/>your freedom from this ſad condition. The Lord make you reſtleſs in your ſpirits, till you have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your deliverance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An unregenerate ſinner muſt needs be in a ſtate of death (becauſe out of Chriſt, who is the fountain of life) and that <hi>in reſpect of condemnation, or liableneſs to eternal death.</hi> As we ſay of a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, when verdict is brought in againſt him, and ſentence is paſſed upon him to be executed, <hi>He is a dead man,</hi> dead in law; and aſſoon as a <hi>writ</hi> for execution cometh forth to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> he will be actually put to death. In this ſenſe every uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner is dead, legally dead, <hi>that is,</hi> He is condemned to be ſent into everlaſting burnings. So that, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaid of themſelves when their firſt-born were ſlain, <hi>We be all dead men, Exod.</hi> 12.23. The like ſad meſſage may I bring to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impenitent perſon amongſt you, <hi>Thou art a dead man, or woman.</hi> Verdict is paſt upon thee as guilty, and ſentence is gone forth againſt thee, to be ſent into the chains of darkneſs: only thou art <hi>reprieved</hi> for a few moments, and hitherto there hath been a <hi>reſpite of execution.</hi> But let me tell thee, if God ſhould ſend a providence to take thee hence in this condition (as for ought thou knoweſt, he may do this night) thou wouldeſt as certainly drop into hell, and there lye for ever, as now thou art upon the land of the living. See a full proof of it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> Mark it, although he be not actually damned, yet he is already condemned; and if he go on in his way, it is impoſſible he ſhould eſcape the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hell. How is he condemned already? <hi>Why,</hi> the Law of God hath pronounced ſentence againſt him, to be caſt into priſon, till he have paid the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64514:167"/>farthing; which will never be paid. The ſinner hath wronged, and rebelled againſt an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being,</hi> and the Law doth ſentence him to make a proportionable ſatisfaction. Now ſeeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not render a ſatisfaction <hi>infinite in worth and valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he is condemned to torments <hi>infinite in duration.</hi> This is the ſentence paſſed upon the wicked, and by reaſon of their unbelief this ſentence ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed: It remaineth in its full force and vigour againſt them; they cannot plead the Goſpel par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their diſcharge: becauſe that pardon is procured through the blood of Chriſt, and given forth to none but ſuch as are united to him. If men were duly ſenſible hereof, how would it diſturb their carnal peace, and cauſe their hearts to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? They would not enjoy a quiet hour, till they had made ſure their acquital from this dreadful ſentence: They would not eat in quiet, leſt the next bit of bread they ſwallow down, ſhould ſtop their breath, and prove as God's executioner to drag them into priſon: They could not ſleep in quiet, leſt before the light of the morning, their ſouls ſhould be required, and ſent into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit of deſtruction. If this point were believed, and laid to heart, <hi>ſurely</hi> it would fill many cloſets and families full of complaints and cryings out, more than if they were under the ſoreſt temporal ſcourge. How would mens retired chambers be filled with prayer, and earneſt deſires after God, to pluck them as fire-brands out of the burning? What pains would they take, to ſue out their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the blood of Chriſt? What welcom enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment would they give unto the Son of God, when he cometh to offer life and ſalvation to them? <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.30. <hi>There was a great cry in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64514:168"/>land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>for there was not an houſe where there was not one dead.</hi> O my brethren, If this doctrine were throughly weighed, what a great cry would be heard in many places and Pariſhes; where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there are few houſes, wherein there are not ſeveral perſons dead; ſentenced to be ſent into the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death? How would mens bowels earn with pity towards their carnal relations, who ſpend their dayes in rejoycings, and are every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in danger of dropping into hell? What mad men ſhould we reckon ungodly perſons to be, that go on in mirth and jollity, or ſpend their time in heaping up the droſs and rubbiſh of the earth, when in the mean time they are perſons dead in Law, condemned to hell? How many do hardly think a ſerious thought of eternity, from one end of the week to the other, when yet there is but a ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and everlaſting burnings? But if this were conſidered, how would they run from one Miniſter to another, and from one Chriſtian to another; with that queſtion, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> I am a condemned perſon, can you give me directions how to get the ſentence repealed? <hi>The Lord cauſe theſe things to ſink deep into your hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a little to drive home this nail of doctrine, I will mind you further of theſe <hi>two things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As Chriſtleſs ſinners are already condemned, ſo <hi>the very glory of God is concerned in their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or in the execution of the ſentence paſt upon them, if they abide in that condition. And that is a matter very dear unto him, whereof he is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender, and wherewith he will never part, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. God made all creatures for his own glory,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64514:168"/>and he will have it from them, <hi>one way, or other.</hi> If you do not glorifie his free grace, by cloſing with Chriſt, and ſubmitting unto him; he will glorifie his juſtice, and ſeverity upon you, in your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baniſhment out of the preſence of Chriſt. It is obſerveable, what is ſaid in the caſe of <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> when they offered up ſtrange fire which God commanded not, and they were conſumed in a dreadful manner with fire from heaven, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Then</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>this is that the Lord ſaid, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid, This I am reſolved upon, that I will have glory from you <hi>one way or other.</hi> If you do not honour me by a due obſervance of my word, I will vindicate mine honour upon you by pouring down the vials of mine indignation. So may I ſay in this caſe, If you do not glorifie God actively in your converſations, he will be glorified upon you in your confuſion: for this is that which he hath determined to have, one way or other. If you do not give glory to God, by ſubmitting to the terms on which ſalvation is offered; you muſt of neceſſity be caſt into outer darkneſs: and God will glorifie his righteouſneſs and truth, and power, and holineſs, in your utter deſtruction; for by one means or other he will be glorified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As impenitent ſinners are dead in Law, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to hell, and eternal death; ſo if they go on ſtill in their ſins, <hi>the infinite mercy of God will never ſave them, from that ſore ruine and deſolation.</hi> This is the conſtant refuge, unto which they have recourſe: <hi>Be it,</hi> that the Law condemneth them, yet God is gracious, and merciful, and full of compaſſion, and therefore they hope he will ſpare them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64514:169"/>Nay, but <hi>O vain man!</hi> If thine heart ſtill goeth after thy deteſtable things, the God of incomprehenſible mercy will not ſhew thee one drop of mercy: He that is unſpeakable in his compaſſions, will not have one dram of pity, or compaſſion upon thy ſoul. It is true, <hi>He is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</hi> 2 Chron. 30.9. But <hi>God ſhall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one as goeth on still in his treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſal. 68.21. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting upon them that fear him, and unto ſuch as keep his Covenant.</hi> Pſal. 103.17, 18. But <hi>he will not be merciful to any wicked tranſgreſſor.</hi> Pſal. 59.5. Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> do not you know that he is a God abundant in truth, as well as rich in mercy? And he will ſhew no mercy to ſinners in a way derogating from his truth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. It is he that hath ſaid, <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that forget God,</hi> Pſal. 9.17. and the Word of the Lord will certainly have its accompliſhment. When thou preſumeſt of mercy, Remember withal, that he is a God of truth; and as ſure as God is true, if thou goeſt on in ſin, and remaineſt ununi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Chriſt, thou wilt periſh for ever, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that God is merciful: For <hi>all the wayes of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto ſuch as keep his covenant and his teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. Alas poor deluded wretch, doſt thou hope for mercy to keep thee from hell, whilſt thou art in a courſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs? <hi>Why man,</hi> The mercy of God will come up in judgment againſt thee, and ſink thee deeper into hell:

What unconceivable torments would be the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them, if conſidered as clothed with all the aggravating circumſtances thereof? Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> when God enters into judgment with the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, he will not abate them one ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Break thou the arm of the wicked, and the evil man: Seek out his wickedneſs, till thou find none.</hi> That is, ſet them down in order, till they are all ſet down: Let not one of them remain untaken-notice of: Let them be ſearched out ſo exactly, till there be no more to be found. We are apt to think, that God will not be ſo ſtrict, as ſome would preſs us to believe: But if you are wicked ſinners, he will not abate you one tranſgreſſion. The very ſins of thy youth, which are ſlipt out of thy memory, God will fill thy bones with them, and make them lie down with thee in the duſt, <hi>Job</hi> 20.11. And as for thy ſecret ſins, which the world could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64514:171"/>he will bring them to light, and ſet them in order before thine eyes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perſons out of Chriſt are in a wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>becauſe they have God for their adverſary:</hi> who is the mighty poſſeſſor of heaven and earth; in whoſe hands are all the corners of the world, and at whoſe command and beck is every creature in being, to fulfil his pleaſure; Againſt whom never did perſon riſe up and proſper; <hi>For he is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength,</hi> Job. 9.4. This all-powerful God is their enemy, that ſetteth againſt them: the living and eternal God, who is able to purſue them that oppoſe him, with fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever: Into whoſe hands therefore it is <hi>a fearful thing to fall, Heb.</hi> 10 31. <hi>Job</hi> 9.4. My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a few right and ſerious apprehenſions of the nature and attributes of God, would make a mans heart ſhiver, and tremble, at the very thoughts of having him for an adverſary. For as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who knoweth the power of his anger? Pſal.</hi> 90.11. No ſecure ſinner knoweth it: for if they did, it would rouſe them out of their ſecurity, and cauſe them to flie for refuge unto the city of refuge,
<note n="*" place="margin">Omnis peccans eſt ignorans.</note> No unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon knoweth it. Had they but a glimps of the diſcovery of it, their ears would tingle at the mention of his being againſt them: It would be a vexation by day and by night, only to underſtand the report of God's being their enemy; who in a moment can break them in pieces like a potters veſſel. <hi>Who knoweth the power of his anger?</hi> The meaning is, It is unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably dreadful, and paſt finding out. So that this
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64514:171"/>alone were ſufficient to beſpeak them throughly miſerable. For may a man ſay to the unregenerate, as the King did to the woman that cried unto him for help, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.27. <hi>If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> If God do not comfort thee, what enjoyments can do it? for they are all at his diſpoſal, and can miniſter no further aſſiſtance than he is pleaſed to put into them.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted ſinners are under a curſe in all that doth concern them.</hi> And how can they expect to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in any of their affairs, when there is a curſe from heaven intermingled therewith? This is the condition of every perſon out of Chriſt, to be an accurſed perſon. And that curſe is of an extenſive nature: It rideth a large circuit; it ſpreadeth it ſelf upon, and inſinuateth it ſelf into every mercy which they receive, and every work they perform, and every place and relation they are in, and every providence they are under, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked.</hi> But what if he go out of his houſe, may he not eſcape it?

The Lord ſhall ſend upon thee curſing, and vexation, and rebuke in all that thou ſetteſt thine hand unto, for to do; until thou be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and until thou periſh quickly: becauſe of the wickedneſs of thy doings, whereby thou haſt forſaken me.</hi> Mark how the curſe purſueth the ungodly; and although he ſtave it off with all his ſtrength and skill, yet it will <hi>come upon him:</hi> And if he flee from it, it will <hi>follow after him:</hi> And if he run ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo faſt it will <hi>overtake and ſeize upon him,</hi> and all that he hath: and will never be removed till he leave his ſins, and get into Chriſt, or elſe be made eternally accurſed. This is the <hi>third particular</hi> to ſet forth the miſery of a Chriſtleſs condition, <hi>It is an accurſed condition.</hi> And it muſt needs be ſo, for Chriſt alone can deliver us from the curſe of the Law: and you can have no redemption through Chriſt, except you are ingraffed into him.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

As a Believer cannot but be bleſſed, becauſe he hath a right to all the exceeding great and precious promiſes of the Goſpel: ſo an unregenerate perſon cannot but be miſerable, becauſe all the dreadful and direful threatnings of the word are his ſhare and portion. And this in very deed is the reaſon, why ſinners for the moſt part cannot endure to be converſant in the word; and it is a trouble and vexation unto them, when paſſages of the Scripture are darted into their Spirits: Becauſe (as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid of <hi>Micaiah</hi>) it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prophecieth good concerning them; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth

All that is written in the Law is ſet againſt them: and if there be not enough written, God will bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them more evils than are expreſly mentioned in the threatnings of the Law. Their inward thought is, that God will not deal ſo ſeverely with them, as is contained in the word.

               <p>So much for the <hi>third Inference,</hi> That perſons out of Chriſt muſt of neceſſity be dead: for <hi>he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi>

               <p>Sol. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Theſe commandments do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any ſpiritual ſtrength in the wicked, <hi>for they are dead:</hi> They have loſt the image of God which was the life of the ſoul.

He may juſtly come and require the debt of obedience at our hands, though we have made our ſelves unable to tender it.

As Chriſt dealt with the young man that was full of ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20, 21. He thought he was able to keep all the commandments of God, and to climbe to heaven by that ladder. And what ſaith our Saviour to him? Why, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Thou thinkeſt thy ſelf able to do whatſoever is commanded; I will trie thy ſtrength, Here is a commandment I give, <hi>go and do it:</hi> and then it quickly appeareth how impotent and unable he was. In this reſpect all the commandments of the Law are to the unregenerate <hi>[praecepta probationis]</hi> precepts for trial. As it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they ſuppoſed they could have kept all that God had ſpoken; and he giveth them his precepts in their full extent and latitude, and leadeth them through the wilderneſs, <hi>to humble them, and to prove them, and to know what was in their hearts,</hi> Deut. 8.1, 2. That is, to make them to know what was in their hearts: for he knew it well enough; all things are naked and open before him; But they could not believe it, that they had ſuch a proneneſs to evil, and ſuch an averſneſs and impotency to that which is good. But by putting them to the trial, God maketh them to know it.</p>

So when Chriſt's call goeth forth unto the wicked, to turn and repent; it doth not ſuppoſe any power in them: but together with his word, he ſends forth the efficacious operation of his Spirit, whereby they are turned, and repentance is wrought within them. And this is according to one of the Statute-Laws of the great God of heaven, <hi>that his Word and Spirit ſhall go forth together.</hi> The holy Ghoſt worketh in the word, and by the word.

               <p n="2">2. THe principal uſe I drive at for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this point, is by way of <hi>examination and Trial.</hi> If union with Chriſt, or having the Son, be of ſuch abſolute neceſſity in order to ſalvation by him; Then it concerneth us to take this doctrine home to our ſelves, and to enter upon a ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate wich, and examination of our ſelves; <hi>whether we be in Chriſt: whether we have the Son, by being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him.</hi> Elſe we have no right to eternal life, but are ſtill in our ſins, and under the wrath of God. So that, as you tender your everlaſting well-being, and the welfare of your immortal ſouls; put this queſtion cloſly to your hearts, and follow it earneſtly till you get a determinate anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <hi>Am I united unto the Son of God? Doth Chriſt dwell in me, and am I ingraffed into him?</hi> It is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infinite weight and moment: for if you fall ſhort of this priviledge, you are ruined everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A miſtake herein may undo you utterly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recovery. This is the foundation of all true peace and comfort; ſo that make a ſtrict enquiry into it. It is a matter which may be known, for the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> telleth us of Believers, that they knew they were in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.5. and Self-examination
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64514:176"/>is the way to know it. And therefore take my counſel in the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you be in the faith: prove your own ſelves: Know you not your own ſelves, how that Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> Examine and prove, <hi>that is,</hi> make a curious and narrow ſearch into it: be very inquiſitive concerning it; ranſack your whole ſouls, that ye may find it out? pierce your ſelves through, leave no ſtone unturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no corner of your hearts unript up. <hi>What! know ye not your own ſelves? q. d.</hi> Is it not a ſhame to be ignorant of your own ſpiritual eſtate, whether you be in Chriſt, and Chriſt be formed in you? Can you reſt contentedly without the knowledge of it? <hi>Why,</hi> if you do not know it, the fault is probably in your ſelves, becauſe you do not ſet upon the work of Self-examination; or you are ſlight and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in that work: ſo that enter upon it throughly and in good earneſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My brethren,</hi> If you knew that you were united to the Son of God, your hearts would be able to make their boaſt of God continually; you might rejoyce in him all the day long; you might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of acceſs unto him, and a gracious acceptance with him, upon all occaſions: you needed not be afraid in times of evil, though one evil rumour come upon the neck of another, and one ſore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity uſher in another. When others walk droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and diſconſolately, you might ſerve the Lord with alacrity and gladneſs of heart; and this joy of the Lord would be your ſtrength. And if you continue out of Chriſt, better were it for you that you had never been born. So that it much lieth upon you, to get the knowledge of it; and therefore call your ſelves to an account, how the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64514:177"/>caſe ſtands with you. Say, <hi>Have I the ſon? Am I planted into Chriſt?</hi> If people are unacquainted with this particular touching themſelves, it is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the neglect, or perſunctory diſcharge of the work of Self-examination: As will evid int<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by theſe <hi>three following conſiderations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Without Self-examination, <hi>a man can never pertinently and appoſitely, apply the Word of God unto himſelf:</hi> nor compare the frame and temper of his ſoul with the Word of the Lord; ſo as to be able to paſs a righteous judgment thereupon. <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> it is the Word of God which is the rule for diſcovery, whether we be in Chriſt or not; (as I ſhall ſhew you more fully anon) but this diſcovery cannot be made, by a bare naked ſpeculation of the truths contained therein, except we perſonally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the truths unto our ſelves, and compare our ſelves with them. Juſt as it is in ſecular matters: The <hi>Carpenters</hi> line and plummet will diſcover the ſtraightneſs, or crookedneſs, of a piece of timber; but this it cannot do by taking a ſingle view of the line, unleſs it be applyed unto the timber. The <hi>Standard</hi> is appointed to ſhew the juſtneſs or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood of weights and meaſures: but then you muſt bring them unto the <hi>ſtandard,</hi> and compare them with the <hi>ſtandard.</hi> So the Scripture is the rule for trial of mens hearts, whether they be ſtraight or crooked: It is the ſtandard to evidence a mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eſtate, whether his perſon will hold weight in the ballance of the ſanctuary, when he cometh to be judged of the Lord: but then he muſt apply this rule unto himſelf, and compare himſelf with this ſtandard. Such perſons as would know that they are of God, muſt not only view the light; but muſt alſo bring their perſons and actions unto the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64514:177"/>light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. <hi>He that doth good cometh unto the light, that his deeds may be manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.</hi> He taketh the light of God's word and his own ſoul, and purteth them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he may ſee what correſpondency there is between the one and the other. And it is ſaid of the wicked, <hi>v.</hi> 20. of that Chapter, <hi>He hateth the light, and doth not come unto it;</hi> that is, He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure perſonally to apply it unto himſelf. You have many carnal people could be content to know the truth <hi>in the general notion,</hi> but they hate it <hi>in the particular application</hi> to their caſe. But if you would know whether you are in Chriſt, you muſt apply and appropriate the word of God unto your ſelves, and compare it with your condition. <hi>Now,</hi> to bring this home to our purpoſe, This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the word, and comparing our ſelves with it, can never be done aright, without ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination. Except the <hi>Phyſician</hi> know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and temperament of the patient, he can never apply ſuitable remedies unto him: ſo except we ſearch and enquire into the frame of our ſouls, we can never apply the Scripture, properly, and ſuitably, unto our ſouls. Except a man ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wayes and actions, as well as into the word, he cannot compare thoſe actions with the word: But he will be apt upon every turn, to run into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and practical errors: He will take that word home to himſelf, which doth not belong to him; and paſs ſuch a ſentence upon himſelf, as is not to be paſſed upon him. It is hinted as the ground of mens deceit, and ſelf-cozenage, becauſe they do not look into themſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.2. <hi>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts.</hi> As if the holy Ghoſt had ſaid, If
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64514:178"/>men did but ſearch their own hearts, they would not be ſo miſtaken concerning their wayes; nor paſs ſuch a falſe judgment upon themſelves. They preſently conclude that their wayes are right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not throughly look into them, nor take a view of their ſpirits, which are the principle of action; <hi>but God ponder eth their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would know, that you are, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are, united to Chriſt, you muſt be diligent in the examination of your ſelves; and the reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe that is the very means which God hath eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially deſigned to this end,</hi> and appointed to be made uſe of to this purpoſe, to bring us unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. This is a <hi>Maxim</hi> in Religion as clear as the noon-day, That if we would comfortably expect any mercy from the Lord, or gracious aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance unto any work or buſineſs, we muſt look for it in the uſe of ſuch means as God hath appointed to that end, and wherein he is wont to convey ſuch grace and aſſiſtance. Now ſelf-examination is the means which God hath required to be made uſe of, to bring us to the knowledge of our ingrafture into Chriſt. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> although it is God alone who can powerfully and convincingly make it known to us; yet we muſt not ſit ſtill and be idle, <hi>and ſay,</hi> if God will diſcover it to me I ſhall know it: But we muſt wait upon him in the way wherein he is wont to meet his people to this end; which is in the duty of ſelf-examination. If we would have our calling and election made ſure, our ſelves muſt give dilige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e to make it ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Self-examination is the way to arrive at this knowledge, whether we are ſpiritually ingraffed into the Son: <hi>Becauſe hereby we ſhall find out thoſe falſhoods, under which our ſpirits are apt to lie hid;</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:64514:178"/>and thoſe deceits whereby our hearts are ready to cheat us, in paſſing a falſe judgment upon our ſelves. Self-examination will ſhew us where the cheat lieth, and upon what ground it is that we deal treacherouſly in this matter. You read of a people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15. who thought themſelves to be free from the wrath of God, when indeed they were the very generation of his wrath. And what was the reaſon of it? whence did this deceit proceed? <hi>Why,</hi> they took ſanctuary in lies, and covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over with falſhoods. <hi>When the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs thorow, it ſhall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falſhood have we hid our ſelves.</hi> The meaning I take to be this; They built their hopes of deliverance upon rotten pillars, and ſandy foundations: They apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves to be in a right way, when they were not: that their hearts were for God, when indeed it was a lie; for they were ſet upon ſin and idolatry, and full of deſperate wickedneſs: They thought they were in the ſervice of the Lord, and that therefore he would ſhew them favour, when <hi>in truth</hi> it was a falſhood; they were in the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction. Now how ſhould a man diſcover the falſhood of theſe pretences, and find out the fallacies whereby our hearts would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us in this caſe? <hi>Why,</hi> By being diligent in the examination of our ſelves. There is a full Text to this purpoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>For if a man think himſelf to be ſomething, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf. But let every man prove his own work, and then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another.</hi> As if he had ſaid, It is no marvel if your hearts beguile you, if you do not make a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſcrutiny into your ſelves. Your ſpirits are
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64514:179"/>treacherous, apt to put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light. You will be apt to entertain good thoughts and opinions of your ſelves, when <hi>perhaps</hi> you have nothing of the life and ſubſtance of godlineſs; and your deceitful hearts take hold of every advantage to ſtrengthen thoſe opinions. But if you would avoid this cheat, you muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves. <hi>Let every man prove his own work</hi>] that is, every one that would not be thus deceived; and in order to the prevention of this ſelf-flattery, and cozenage. If you were much in ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, you would not reſt in the good opinions of others; nor conclude you were holy, becauſe they thought well of you: or you would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of your ſpiritual eſtate, from the lives of others; that therefore you are the children of God, becauſe you are not ſo bad as they; or that you were in Covenant with the Lord, becauſe others run faſter than you in the devils ſervice: But upon the through trial of your ſelves it would be ſeen, whether you have any ſubſtantial ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>let me tell you again,</hi> If you love your ſouls, if you would be aſſured to eſcape everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vengeance, that you are perſons in favour with God, and ſhall arrive with ſaſety at the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, when all impenitent ſinners are bound up in bundles together, and caſt into hell fire; make it appear that you are united to Chriſt. Get knowledge and aſſurance that you have the Son; and to that end be diligent in the ſearch of your ſelves: for ſelf-examination is the way to know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will ſay,</hi> What courſe ſhall we take in the ſearch of this matter? or in what method ſhall
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64514:179"/>we proceed, in this examination of our ſelves, that thereupon we may know whether we be ingraffed into Chriſt? This is a work and duty, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge whereof eternal life it ſelf lieth at the ſtake; if it be not managed aright, it may prove the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a mans utter ruine and deſtruction. And therefore I will inſiſt upon it <hi>ſomewhat largely,</hi> by paſſing over <hi>theſe three heads of particulars.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with the firſt, of ſhewing you wherein your work lieth in this buſineſs of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether you be one with Chriſt, and have the Son: or <hi>what this duty of ſelf-examination is.</hi> Which is a mater needful to be a little explained: Becauſe, <hi>it is to be feared,</hi> that multitudes, who are called Chriſtians, are much in the dark as to any diſtinct knowledge of the nature of this work: that they are not only ſtrangers to the practiſe of it, but in a great meaſure as to any clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions concerning it. But I ſhall not handle it by way of deſcription, <hi>at large;</hi> only I will give you
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64514:180"/>ſome hints of the moſt material points, which have a reference to this work, and that will be needful to open our way for the directions I would give you, for the right management thereof.

                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. The firſt concluſion is this, <hi>That ſelf-examination, as to our union with Chriſt, is for the matter of it, a compounded duty; made up of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſpiritual and reflexive action, in relation to a mans ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is
<list>
                     <item>1. A <hi>ſearch,</hi> or <hi>enquiry</hi> made into a mans ſelf.</item>

                  </list> a mans ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mark it Sirs,</hi> It doth not lie in one only ſingle act of the ſpirit, but it doth conſiſt of ſeveral acts. For as there are ſome <hi>complicated ſins,</hi> which carry many tranſgreſſions together in the bowels of them: So there are ſome duties, which we may call <hi>complicated</hi> or <hi>compounded duties.</hi> And ſuch is this of ſelf-examination; wherein there are many actions folded up together: For it comprehends a <hi>threefold</hi> reflexive <hi>act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an act of <hi>inſpection,</hi> or <hi>retroſpection into a mans ſelf:</hi> A ſearch or enquiry made into our perſons and wayes; our inward qualifications, and all our performances. He that examineth himſelf, muſt curiouſly pry, and look into his own heart and practiſe; into his principles and converſation, and into all the workings of thoſe principles, and the manner of them. He muſt deſcend into, and take a narrow view of every corner of his ſpirit,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64514:180"/>and the ſeveral parts of his demeanour: As a man would look with a candle into every room, and caſt his eye into every hole and crany of an houſe, for the finding out any thing which is loſt. You have it under this very ſimilitude, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly.</hi> It is the candle of the Lord] <hi>that is,</hi> there is a ſpecial faculty put into a mans ſoul by God himſelf, whereby he is enabled to make enquiry into his innermoſt thoughts, and and the ſecret operations of his own heart: in the exerciſe whereof he may make a narrow ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into himſelf, and look <hi>wiſtly</hi> into what is within him, or hath been done by him: as a man doth that taketh a torch, or candle, to ſee that which could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be perceived.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64514:181"/>meditate thereupon; with what ſpiritualneſs and faithfulneſs, he doth fill up his particular calling and relations. When he doth take a review of all his affairs on a ſpiritual account. As a man that hath loſt any thing in his travels, he goeth over them back again, in his thoughts: He conſidereth where he was ſuch a day, and what place he lay in the other night, and who was in his company, and where he was moſt likely to leave that which he miſſeth. So doth a Chriſtian, who is ſerious inſelf-examination; he doth traverſe his wayes back again, in his retired contemplations. He bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, what indowments he hath, with what circumſpection he hath walked, how he hath improved this opportunity, and redeemed the other part of his time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the <hi>firſt reflexine act</hi> whereof this work is compounded, <hi>viz.</hi> An act of <hi>inſpection,</hi> or <hi>retroſpection into a mans ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an act of <hi>probation and trial of amans ſelf.</hi> When a perſon that examines himſelf hath found out the particulars to be obſerved, touching his heart and wayes, he doth not reſt there: but immediately bringeth all to the teſt and touchſtone, that he may ſee of what ſort his qualifications are, and of what kind his actions have been: whether they are of the right metal and ſtamp, as they ought to be; and as he would have them to be: whether they be ſuch as will paſs for currant in the court of Heaven. As a careful <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> when he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſum of mony, doth not only count the pieces; but if any of them be ſuſpected, or look but ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, he trieth them, whether they be ſuch as will paſs in payment: So doth a Chriſtian in this ſpiritual work of the examination of himſelf, touching his union with Chriſt; Firſt he obſerveth
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64514:181"/>and takes notice what is within him, and what hath been done by him, and then he trieth what metal they are of: <hi>that is,</hi> whether the graces which appear to be within him, are ſaving graces indeed, or only counterfeit coin: And whether his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be evangelical and ſpiritual obedience, or not: And whether the ſins which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted be ſuch as may be ſtiled, <hi>The ſpots of God's children,</hi> or no. And <hi>the reaſon of it lieth in this,</hi> Becauſe, in ſoul concernments, eſpecially, there is oftentimes a vaſt difference betwixt reality, and appearance. Many things at the firſt view, ſeem to be right and good; When upon a ſtricter enquiry they are found falſe and rotten. And therefore, if we would not be deceived, all things muſt be proved and tried. This is mentioned as an act di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the former, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch, and try our wayes.</hi> Firſt we muſt labour to find out our wayes what they have been; and then trie them by the light of the Word, of what ſort they have been: wherein they accord with the rule, how we have deviated from it, or fallen ſhort of living up thereunto. This is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called, <hi>The weighing of a mans ſelf:</hi> in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the practiſe of <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> in their negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and traffick. They do not only view the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which they buy, but then they put them into the ſcales, to ſee if they will hold weight, for what they wefe bought. So doth a careful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as to his demeanour. Firſt he obſerveth his own qual fications and performances; and then he he trieth whether they will hold weight in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. <hi>Job</hi> 31.5, 6. <hi>If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath haſted to deceit: Let me be weighed in an even ballance, that God may know mine integrity; q. d.</hi> Let my actions be throughly fifted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64514:182"/>looked, and they will be found ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto the Lord. This is the <hi>ſecond reflexive act,</hi> whereof ſelf-examination is made up or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>concluſive determination,</hi> or <hi>the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſentence and judgment upon a mans ſelf,</hi> according to that ſearch and trial. As it is in <hi>Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature</hi> amongſt men; when the cauſe is throughly opened, and witneſſes produced, and the Law conſulted in the caſe; then according thereunto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is brought in, and ſentence pronounced. <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> ſelf-examination is the erecting of a <hi>Court of Judicature</hi> in a mans breaſt; where, upon trial of the matter, judgment doth paſs for, or againſt the perſon.

                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2. The <hi>ſpecial faculty or power of the ſoul, by which this work of ſelf-examination is performed, is the</hi> practical judgment, <hi>or conſcience of a man.</hi> That is the reflexive eye of the ſoul, whereby a perſon is inabled to look inward; and to take an account of his own heart and wayes. There is a <hi>twofold ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eye,</hi> whereby a man hath preheminence above all the inferiour creatures. 1. There is the eye of the <hi>ſpeculative underſtanding,</hi> in the exerciſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he taketh a view of matters without himſelf, at the remoteſt diſtance of place, or time. 2. The eye of the <hi>practical judgment</hi> or <hi>conſcience,</hi> whereby he doth reflect upon himſelf, and animadvert upon his own ſpirit, and wayes. So that your work, in this reſpect, if you would rightly examine your ſelves touching your union with Chriſt, is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get <hi>an awakened conſcience,</hi> and a <hi>well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed conſcience,</hi> and a <hi>faithful conſcience,</hi> free from guile and ſelf-flattery. It concerneth you to take heed of deadneſs, and ſecurity, and treachery in the conſcience: For as that is the faculty which doth eye and obſerve a man in his wayes; ſo whereby
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64514:183"/>he is impowred to take an account of thoſe wayes, and to acquit or condemn himſelf, according to the merits of the cauſe, and as the matter doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. You read of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had a witneſs on his ſide, that he was a ſervant of God, and walked in ſincerity before the Lord; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his heart was filled with joy and gladneſs. And <hi>what was that witneſs?</hi> Why, his conſcience had examined and found it to be ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity &amp; godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world.</hi> And both the buſineſs of accuſing, and abſolving a ſinner is attributed thereunto, namely to the workings of conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another,</hi> Joh. 8.9. <hi>They went out one by one, being convicted by their own conſciences.</hi> This you are ſometimes to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>the heart and ſpirit</hi> of a man, when it is ſaid to take cognizance of the things which are within him. <hi>The heart knoweth its own bitterneſs,</hi> Prov. 14.10. <hi>What man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him?</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. Again <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>Alſo take no heed to all words that are ſpoken, leſt thou hear thy ſervant curſe thee. For oftentimes alſo thine own heart knoweth, that thou thy ſelf likewiſe haſt curſed others.</hi> That is, If you would ſet your conſciences awork, they would declare plainly what is the filthineſs that cleaveth to you, and the abominations that have been committed by you. So that your care muſt be to keep life, and vigour, and activity in your conſciences: and you muſt take heed to your ſelves, that no miſtakes, or falſhoods, or practical errors ſettle within your conſciences.</p>

Although it be the conſcience of a man, by which he doth examine himſelf touching his union with Chriſt, and paſſeth judgment upon himſelf in that caſe: <hi>yet this work can never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed effectually and to purpoſe, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, and the powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ence of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is the Spirit of God, by whom the conſcience of a ſinner is excited and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up unto this work, and directed and guided therein; that it may ſee clearly into matters, and may paſs a right and convincing ſentence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. It is the ſame Spirit alone which converteth a ſinner from his natural eſtate, that can <hi>convincingly</hi> ſhew him his ſad eſtate in order to converſion. And the ſame Spirit alone which planteth grace into the ſoul, can diſcover that grace where it is planted; that ſo a Believer may take comfort therein, and conclude from thence that he is ingraffed into Chriſt. And therefore when we attain any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evidences of our eſtate Godward, we are ſaid, to be <hi>ſealed by the Spirit:</hi> becauſe it depends upon his aſſiſtance and teſtimony, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>In whom alſo, after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe: which is the earneſt of our inheritance.</hi> It is a manner of ſpeech taken from the practiſe of men; who for confirmation and aſſurance of a deed or grant, give writings under ſeal: ſo hath the Lord been pleaſed, <hi>ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> to deal with you; you have not only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of acceptance, and pardon, and eternal life made unto you; but theſe promiſes are ſealed. <hi>How? Why,</hi> by the teſtimony of the Spirit. Again, in making of a bargain men are wont to give <hi>earneſt</hi> to confirm it; which is not only a part of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for aſſurance of the whole: This earneſt,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64514:184"/>
                  <hi>ſaith he,</hi> you have received; which is the witneſs of the holy Ghoſt. It is not the teſtimony of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alone, can make a man <hi>effectually</hi> to know his relation to Chriſt, or ſeparation from Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrent operation of the Spirit. There is a famous Text in reference to both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage, again to fear: but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we cry</hi> Abba <hi>father.</hi> Mark it, If a man be brought into bondage by the knowledge of his undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by ſeeing himſelf to lie under the guilt of his ſins, and obnoxious to the inſupportable wrath of God, it is through the operation of the Spirit: And if he be able to plead his adoption, and to look up unto God as his Father in Chriſt; it is by the efficacious workings of the ſame Spirit. So that for the examination of your ſelves concerning your union with Chriſt, and finding out whether you are knit unto him, your work <hi>in this reſpect</hi> lieth in two things (1) In being earneſt <hi>petitioners</hi> and <hi>ſupplicants</hi> at the throne of grace, for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, to make this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to you; to ſtrike in with your conſciences in bearing witneſs unto your ſpiritual eſtate. <hi>That the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the father of glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: that the eyes of your underſtandings being enlightned, ye may know, what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints,</hi> Eph. 1.17, 18. (2) Your buſineſs lieth in <hi>a careful attendance upon the dictates of the Spirit,</hi> and taking heed that you reſiſt not the holy Ghoſt, in theſe actings. For it is an ordinary thing in many of the people of God <hi>to be acceſſary to the diſconſolateneſs of their own ſouls,</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:64514:184"/>by oppoſing the ſpirit of conſolation. They go on without that comfort, which they might have, in the knowledge of their union with Chriſt, becauſe they refuſe to be comforted: as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. This is a common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in times of ſtrong temptations. As the ungodly reſiſt <hi>the ſpirit of conviction,</hi> and <hi>converſion:</hi> ſo believers themſelves are apt to withſtand, and ſtrive againſt, <hi>the ſpirit of conſolation.</hi> And therefore your work is to give diligent attendance upon the Spirit, and to hear attentively what he ſhall ſpeak unto you.</p>

                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 4. The way of procedure in this buſineſs of ſelf-examination, or the means whereby it muſt be found out, whether we are united to Chriſt, is, <hi>By conſulting and enquiring into thoſe marks and ſigns, which are the evidencing characters, and properties of that union.</hi> For <hi>Sirs,</hi> the change wrought upon a Believer, by his oneneſs with Chriſt, is a <hi>relative change;</hi> and cannot be ſeen immediately in it ſelf, and of it ſelf: But it is diſcerned and diſcovered unto the ſpirit of a man, by its properties and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants; which are as certain <hi>characteriſtical marks,</hi> and tokens, whereby the ſtate of union with Chriſt is differenced, and diſtinguiſhed, from that of being ſtrangers unto him. As it is in natural things, If I would know, whether this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtone be a true diamond, or a counterfeit; whether this, or the other piece of money, be pure gold, or adulterate metal; I muſt conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it have the properties of pure gold; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtone have the properties of a right dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, or not: So <hi>upon a ſpiritual account,</hi> If I would know whether I am one with Chriſt, and in the ſtate of grace, I muſt enquire whether I be made
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64514:185"/>partaker of ſuch things as are the properties and concomitants of that eſtate, and peculiar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Theſe we call <hi>marks,</hi> and <hi>ſigns;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they denote and ſignifie, what ſpiritual condition a perſon is in.

               </p>
               <p>I know there are ſome who have ſpoken very ſlightly and contemptibly of this way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: They would have us only depend upon the <hi>immediate witneſs of the Spirit,</hi> without making uſe of theſe marks and ſigns. But <hi>my Brethren,</hi> this is the way which the ſervants of God have taken, in paſſing a judgment upon themſelves; who are left upon record in the Scripture, as patterns for our imitation. And if you would not be deluded, you muſt take this courſe likewiſe. For elſe how ſhall we know, that ſuch an immediate teſtimony, <hi>as they ſpeak of,</hi> is from the Spirit of God, and not a deluſion of Satan, or a fond perſwaſion of our own deceitful ſpirits, but by bringing it to the touchſtone of theſe marks and ſigns? See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</hi> Mind it, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> we are acquainted with Chriſt, and intereſted in him; and through grace we may come to the knowledge of it. How, or by what means? <hi>Why,</hi> by this mark or character, <hi>if we keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> that will be a certain ſign or evidence of it. 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> As if he had ſaid, By this mark or character we diſcern our tranſlation into the ſtate of grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. <hi>I am thine, ſave me, for I have ſought thy precepts.</hi> Mark it, <hi>David</hi> had not only a title to the favour of God, but he
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64514:185"/>was able to plead that title; <hi>I am thine.</hi> How do you prove it? <hi>Why,</hi> by this mark or evidence, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſought thy precepts.</hi> My brethren, the ſoul of a man is not acted in this work, <hi>by way of Enthuſiaſme;</hi> nor are we to depend upon a <hi>ſpecial revelation:</hi> but the work is to be carried on by way of <hi>ſpiritual reaſoning</hi> or <hi>argumentation. Thus,</hi> he who hath reſpect to all the commandments of God, hath the Son, and is united unto the Son: Now, <hi>ſaith the ſoul,</hi> through grace I find, upon a diligent ſearch of my ſelf, that I bear a reſpect to all Gods commmandments; and from thence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that I have the Son of God, and am ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into him. <hi>Again,</hi> He that loveth the Brethren is in the ſtate of grace, tranſlated from death to life. And through mercy, <hi>ſaith the ſoul,</hi> I find this property in my ſelf: So that hence I gather, that I am in the ſtate of grace. Take an inſtance on the other hand.</p>
               <q>Whoſoever walketh in darkneſs, hath no fellowſhip with Chriſt. My conſcience tells me, <hi>ſaith the ſinner,</hi> that I walk in darkneſs. Hence it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently followeth, that, whilſt I remain in this condition, I have no fellowſhip with Chriſt.</q>
               <p>So that the convictions of conſcience, on the one hand, as to the ſad eſtate of a ſinner; are <hi>rational convictions:</hi> and the witneſs of conſcience on the other hand, in behalf of the Saints, that they are in Chriſt, is a <hi>rational witneſs;</hi> and the Spirit of God doth joyn in a concurrent teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> Mark it, not only <hi>to our ſpirits,</hi> but <hi>with our ſpirit.</hi> They joyn together in giving evidence of a Believers union with Chriſt. This is the fourth concluſion,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64514:186"/>
                  <hi>That the way of procedure, in this buſineſs of ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, is by marks and ſigns.</hi> For my part, I do not queſtion, but the holy Ghoſt may pleaſe, at ſome peculiar ſeaſons, to dart comfort <hi>(as it were)</hi> into the heart of a Believer; and in <hi>a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate way,</hi> to ſignifie to him, that he is in favour with God, and in a ſtate of reconciliation; without any expreſs or ſenſible reflection, <hi>at that inſtant of time,</hi> upon the gracious qualifications, which are the marks of that eſtate: But then remember, that <hi>in the concluſion</hi> it muſt be reduced to marks and ſigns. For elſe, how ſhall a Chriſtian be ſatisfied, that it was indeed from the Spirit of God, unleſs he prove it by ſuch evidencing properties as are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that end?</p>
               <p>

                     <item>1. <hi>Excluſive,</hi> or <hi>Negative.</hi> markes and properties.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There are <hi>excluſive,</hi> or <hi>negative marks and ſigns,</hi> as to union with Chriſt. Properties <hi>of the firſt rank</hi> as they are commonly ſtiled: <hi>that is,</hi> ſuch as belong <hi>to all</hi> who are ingraffed into the Lord Jeſus, but do <hi>not ſolely,</hi> or <hi>peculiarly,</hi> appertain to them: They are of a greater extent and latitude than union with Chriſt is. <hi>To make it plain by inſtances,</hi> Theſe are properties of the firſt rank, <hi>viz.</hi> To have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened underſtanding, and competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the myſteries of godlineſs: To be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the evil of ſin, and to have the conſcience awakened in the ſenſe of it: To believe the word of God to be true: To perform external duties, and to carry on a reformation in the life and practiſe, <hi>and the like.</hi> Theſe are properties <hi>to be found in all,</hi> who are knit unto Chriſt; <hi>but not in them only.</hi> An unregenerate perſon may partake of them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And what is the uſe of theſe in the work of ſelf-examination, as to our union with Chriſt? <hi>Why,</hi> By the want of theſe, a perſon may conclude <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is not in Chriſt: but by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of theſe alone he cannot conclude <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> that he is in him. Therefore I call them <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive marks,</hi> for diſtinction ſake. The abſence of any of theſe, will be a ſign that a perſon is excluded
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64514:187"/>from this priviledge of <hi>having the Son;</hi> but the preſence of them will not prove that he is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thereof. If a ſinner hath no knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths, but is groſly ignorant of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion, he may conclude <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is none of Chriſt's, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 2.4. But although he hath much knowledge of the principles of Religion, he cannot from thence conclude <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that he doth belong to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. See it in the caſe of <hi>legal humiliation.</hi> A man may conclude <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is not a child of God, if he were never humbled for ſins againſt the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.9, 10. But he cannot gather <hi>in the affirmative,</hi> that he is at peace with God, only becauſe he hath felt ſome trouble upon his ſpirit for tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 27, 29. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16, 17. In the caſe of <hi>outward reformation,</hi> a perſon may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is not in covenant with God, if he live in the practiſe of open ſins, and the common neglect of external duties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1, 2, 3. But he cannot infer <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that he is one of the peculiar people of God, becauſe he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the practiſe of ſome groſſer wickedneſſes, &amp; ſetteth upon the diſcharge of ſome outward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 12. <hi>So I might go over the reſt.</hi> Every true Believer is convinced of the evil of ſin; but all perſons under convinction of ſin cannot ſay, that therefore they are true Believers. All ſincere Chriſtians have their conſciences awakened, and aſſent to the truth of Scripture-doctrines: But it will not follow, that all whoſe conſciences are awakened, and believe the Scriptures <hi>by an hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faith,</hi> are to be reckoned amongſt the number of ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:64514:187"/>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>incluſive marks,</hi> or properties <hi>of the ſecond rank:</hi> which belong <hi>only</hi> to ſuch as are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, but are not to be found in all of them. <hi>As now for instance,</hi> To have ſuch high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this, or the other grace, as ſome believers have attained: To have ſuch a meaſure of power over their luſts and corruptions, as ſome eminent Saints have had: To be verſed in the higher my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of godlineſs, as they who have their ſpiritual ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern betwixt good and evil. To be ſtrong in the faith, as <hi>Abraham;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for meekneſs, as <hi>Moſes;</hi> and eminent for patience, as <hi>Job;</hi> and to labour more abundantly, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and the like. Now what is the uſe of this ſort of marks in the work of ſelf-examination? <hi>Why,</hi> from the attainment of them, a Chriſtian may conclude <hi>affirmatively,</hi> with a great deal of clearneſs and undoubtedneſs, that he is a member of Chriſt: But he cannot from the want of them conclude <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is not intereſted in Chriſt. <hi>And this is the reaſon,</hi> Becauſe a mans ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtate Godward, and Chriſtward, doth not depend upon the degrees of grace; but upon the truth of grace. A perſon may have his heart ſound in the ſtatutes of God, who hath not arrived at that meaſure of acquaintance with God, as ſome others have done. There are ſeveral forms of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the School of Chriſt, and yet all of them ſavingly taught by him. There are divers ranks of perſons in the houſhold of faith, of different growth and ſtature; <hi>babes,</hi> and <hi>children;</hi> as well as <hi>men</hi> grown up to their full ſtrength, and <hi>old experienced diſciples,</hi> Mat. 15.28. Mat. 8.26. 1 Joh. 2.12, 13. Rev. 3.8.</p>
               <p>This is well to be obſerved, becauſe the neglect
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64514:188"/>of the conſideration of this very thing, hathoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the troubles and perplexities of many poor ſouls, that walk in the anguiſh and bitterneſs of their ſpirits. They cannot find ſuch workings in their own hearts, as ſometimes are mentioned to be in the hearts of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other ſervants of God in Scripture; and from thence they preſently draw ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences touching themſelves; that ſurely their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is naught, and their hearts are rotten: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>poſſibly</hi> theſe are workings of ſpirit that are not ever to be found in all the people of God; but only in ſome that are eminent above others, and have attained to an higher pitch of godlineſs than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Only let me add this as a <hi>memento</hi> by the way, That the weakeſt believer, who hath the leaſt degrees of grace, is ſtill preſſing after the higheſt. He doth not ſit down contented with any meaſures attained; but is ſtill thirſting after more. He would, if it were poſſible, pluck up corruption by the very root, out of his ſoul; and be ſerviceable unto the Lord at the higheſt rate, and in the moſt excellent manner, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are <hi>adaequate,</hi> and <hi>proportionate marks and ſigns of our union with Chriſt.</hi> Such as are of an <hi>even ſize</hi> with the ſtate of grace; that carry the ſame breadth with them, as intereſt in Chriſt doth; and run exactly and preciſely, parallel thereto. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties <hi>in the ſtricteſt acception,</hi> that are to be found <hi>only</hi> in the children of God, and are to be found <hi>in all</hi> of them without exception, and <hi>at all times</hi> and ſeaſons. As now for inſtance, To have the Law of God wrote upon our hearts; to worſhip God in Spirit; to hate every falſe way; to walk before the Lord, as in his ſight and preſence; to reſign up
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:64514:188"/>our ſelves unreſervedly to Chriſt, and to God by him. And theſe are as <hi>two-edged ſwords,</hi> that cut both wayes. In the examination of your ſelves, and paſſing judgment upon your ſelves, touching your union with Chriſt, you may conclude from them both <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>affirmatively.</hi> If you be without theſe qualifications, you are ſtrangers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: and ſuch as are thus qualified, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into him.

               <p>Theſe <hi>adaequate properties</hi> are ſuch as you ſhould principally take notice of, and ſelect for your uſe in the trial of your union with Chriſt; and for the clearing of it up to your ſelves, whether you are ingraffed into him. You will know them by theſe three conditions. 1. There muſt be <hi>univerſality of the ſubject,</hi> they muſt be found in all perſons uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Son. 2. <hi>Peculiarity,</hi> they muſt be ſuch as belong only unto them. 3. <hi>Indefiniteneſs of time,</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:64514:189"/>ſuch as appertain to the Saints at all ſeaſons. This is <hi>the fifth Concluſion</hi> I intended, to open the nature of ſelf-examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 6. The laſt aſſertion is this. <hi>That ſuch marks and ſigns, of whatever ſort they be, whereupon a Chriſtian may confidently reſt in the examination of himſelf, and according to the tenour of which he may paſs a righteous ſentence upon himſelf, whether he be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt; muſt be clearly deduced from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and plainly bottomed thereupon.</hi> Mark it, <hi>I ſay,</hi> if you would not be deceived and proceed upon miſtakes, you muſt fetch your evidences from thence; and ſee that they be ſuch characters of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as are warranted thereby. Elſe you may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly get ſome preſumptuous hopes, but you can never attain unto a well-grounded aſſurance: For the Word of God is the only ſure foundation, which you can build upon; in this caſe of enquiry. And <hi>the reaſon lieth herein,</hi> becauſe our Lord Jeſus in his proceedings, will judge us by the Scriptures, and paſs everlaſting ſentence upon us according to the tenour of the Scriptures: And therefore by that rule we ſhould judge our ſelves. If a man have a trial at Law, touching his eſtate or life; and would know before-hand, whether his cauſe be good; he doth not depend upon what this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours thoughts are, or the others opinion is: But he ſearcheth the Law, and addreſſeth himſelf to men skilful in the Law; as knowing the judge will proceed according to that Rule. Why <hi>Sirs,</hi> At the great and general <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> Chriſt will try all cauſes by the Word of God, and paſs judgment upon all ſorts according to the Word: ſo that by it we are to be guided in the trial of our ſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64514:189"/>words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have ſpoken the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> As Chriſt himſelf is ordained to be the judge of the quick and dead: ſo the doctrines which he hath delivered, will be the rule of all his judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; both in acquitting the righteous, and condemning the wicked. You read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. that when judgment is ſet, <hi>The books ſhall be opened:</hi> And this is one of thoſe books which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with in the caſe, <hi>The book of the Statutes and Ordinances of the King of heaven;</hi> the Law which he appointed for a teſtimony in <hi>Jacob.</hi> As the <hi>book</hi> of every mans <hi>conſcience</hi> ſhall be opened for their conviction, wherein they ſhall read their guilt in legible characters: For that is a book of record wherein mens actions are entred; and although now it be ſhut, and ſinners will not look into it; many of the lines and ſentences are almoſt oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or blotted, that they cannot be read: Yet at the day of accounts, God will refreſh and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the luſtre of thoſe ancient writtings. And as the <hi>book of life</hi> ſhall be opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> the decrees of God will be then publiſhed and made known, which now are ſealed up in his breaſt, and locked up in his <hi>Archives.</hi> Then it will be ſeen who are appointed to life, for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the free grace of God; and whom he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to leave in their ſins and periſh, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of his juſtice. <hi>I ſay,</hi> As theſe books ſhall be opened, ſo there is another book to be made uſe of in that day, <hi>to wit,</hi> The great Statute-book of the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>the records</hi> of the Goſpel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.12. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of liberty;</hi> i. e. by the word of the truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt; the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64514:190"/>whole Word of God regiſtred in the Scriptures, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.23, 25. which, if hearkened unto, is the means to ſet men at liberty from their bondage to ſin, and Satan: <hi>By the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> which though it give no manner of countenance unto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, but is a ſtrong argument againſt it; yet proclaimeth liberty to penitent ſinners, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, upon a due ſubmiſſion to the government of Chriſt. Beſides it may be called a <hi>Law of liberty</hi> or freedom, becauſe it doth not flatter any man as to his ſpiritual condition, but dealeth openly and freely with him, and telleth him his own, without tergiverſation. And this affords us <hi>another reaſon</hi> why we ſhould fetch our marks of union from the Scripture; becauſe it will deal freely and plainty in the diſcovery of our ſpiritual eſtate, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons. For <hi>Sirs,</hi> if you build your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon the opinions of men, or upon the bare dictates of your own hearts; you may be deceived. Men may ſooth you up in your ſins; and your hearts will flatter you; but the word of God will deal freely, and impartially with you: It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent matters as they are, in their own proper colours, <hi>without favour, or affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this is an excellent means to overthrow preſumptuous hopes, and to build aright in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of eternal life; when we fetch <hi>all our marks and ſigns of being in Chriſt,</hi> from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and bring our evidences unto the Scriptures. Thou hopeſt to be ſaved through Chriſt, becauſe thou waſt born in the Church, and baptized, and performeſt ſome outward duties of Chriſt's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Nay, but, <hi>Ovain man,</hi> where doth the Scripture ſay, theſe are tokens and evidences of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64514:190"/>with Chriſt, and ſalvation through him? Thou hopeſt for admiſſion into heaven, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt, becauſe thou art free from ſuch ſcandalous ſins, whereof others are guilty: thou knoweſt ſuch and ſuch truths, whereof many are ignorant: or becauſe ſuch godly perſons converſe with thee, and have a good opinion of thee. But, <hi>poor deluded wretch,</hi> where doth the Scripture ſay, that any, or all of theſe are marks of having the Son, or of coming to the kingdom of heaven, by the mediation of the Son? Remember, <hi>my bres thren,</hi> that the Word of God is appointed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the rule of faith, and guide of our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo for the trial of our ſpiritual eſtate; whether we be intereſted in Chriſt, and united unto him: That we may have hopes indeed, and not only a preſumptuous confidence, which will make us aſhamed at the laſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>For whatſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If you be loath to enter throughly, into the diſquiſition of this matter, and to debate the caſe with your ſelves, whether you are one with Chriſt, or not; <hi>That very thing</hi> will be a ſhrewd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt you, that you are utter ſtrangers unto Chriſt; and in no wiſe partakers of ſalvation through him. It will be a ſign that your profeſſion is unſound, and your hearts rotten, when you are unwilling to ſearch into your ſpiritual condition. As when a <hi>Tradeſman</hi> will not ſuffer his wares to be throughly viewed, it miniſters ground of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are not right and good: <hi>So it is in theſe ſpiritual affairs;</hi> If you are hardly brought to make enquiry into your ſelves, it will yield matter of ſuſpition, that you are conſcious of ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs allowed in your ſelves; and that your hearts are not right in the ſight of the Lord. For <hi>my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> It is not truth, but falſhood, that hateth the light, and will not come to the light, leſt it ſhould be diſcovered.

It concerns you to examine diligently, whether you be united unto Chriſt, <hi>Becauſe</hi> it is an ordinary thing for men and women to be miſtaken in this reſpect: to think that they have the Son, and are in a ſtate of ſalvation, when as in truth they lie ſtill in the gall of bitterneſs: And this miſtake is the cauſe of their eternal ruine. From hence it is that they neglect to ſeek after a remedy, becauſe in their own apprehenſions they are ſafe already: For, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>They that be whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick,</hi> Mat. 9.12.

It is the knowledge of a ſinners periſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will cauſe him to hunger and thirſt after the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and make him reſtleſs in his ſpirit till he get into Chriſt. Theſe are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom Chriſt is ſent, to bring deliverance; ſuch as find they are ſinners, and are heavy laden under the burden of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. They are <hi>ſuch loſt ſheep,</hi> which the great Shepherd of ſouls will ſeek after; <hi>that is,</hi> ſuch as are ſenſible of their loſt condition, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.16. <hi>I will ſeek that which is loſt, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that which was ſick: But I will deſtroy the fat and the ſtrong, and feed them with judgment.</hi> And it is ignorance of mens miſery and wretchedneſs, which is the devils great engine, whereby he carrieth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners blindfold, and headlong into the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. As the knowledge of the diſeaſe is the firſt part of the cure; ſo it is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans damnable condition, which is one of the firſt ſteps unto his converſion and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>This is all I ſhall ſpeak <hi>to the ſecond head</hi> under the Uſe of <hi>Trial:</hi> By way of motive and provocative thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let me cloſe this Uſe with <hi>ſome ſpecial dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> to guide you in the diſcharge of this work of ſelf-examination: That you may come to a right concluſion, and reſolution of the caſe, <hi>Whether you are ſpiritually ingraffed into Chriſt, and be ſuch as have the Son, and life through him, or not.</hi> And here I might give you a catalogue of Scripture-marks and evidences, for trial upon this account: But I
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64514:197"/>ſhall not multiply particulars; we will only inſiſt upon the principal matter to be enquired into, for proof of your union with the Son of God. And a little to direct you in the method of your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein, that it may be done effectually and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, you muſt diligently heed and obſerve theſe following <hi>Rules of advice;</hi> wherein I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>by way of gradation,</hi> the better to help both your underſtandings and memories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. For the examination and trial of your ſelves, and in order to the paſſing a righteous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon your ſelves, whether you are united to Chriſt, <hi>You muſt, firſtly, and fundamentally enquire, if the grace of regeneration hath been poured out upon you, and a ſound converſion wrought within you.</hi> This is the <hi>foundation evidence</hi> of a mans having the Son; and other marks are made uſe of for diſcovery of this, and in a ſubſerviency to the manifeſtation hereof. <hi>And the reaſon of it is obvious,</hi> Becauſe in the day of converſion this union is made up: By the ſpirit of regeneration, Chriſt doth take poſſeſſion of ſinners for himſelf; and by a living faith, which is one of the graces then planted in their ſouls, they do receive Chriſt, and embrace him as theirs: and ſo are knit unto him; <hi>as hath been largely opened.</hi> By a through converſion, the Lord Jeſus doth cull out a people from the world, and gather them unto himſelf: So that this is primarily and chiefly to be ſought into, whether you are truly converted, and made partakers of the renewing grace of the holy Ghoſt. For <hi>if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Here is the grand queſtion, <hi>Are we new creatures? Is there a through change wrought upon our ſpirits? Is corruption mortified in us, and the power of it ſubdued; and a new principle of holineſs
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64514:198"/>put into, and ingraven upon our hearts?</hi> Thus it will be if you are one with Chriſt. Except you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, you are ſtrangers to him, and have no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intereſt in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead, becauſe of ſin: but the Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſs.</hi> The body is dead] <hi>that is,</hi> the body of corruption is mortified, and the force of it is taken away, whereby it exerciſed dominion over you: As before you were dead in ſin, ſo now you are dead unto ſin; and quickned and made alive unto righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Here is the failure of many, and the occaſion of their being deceived in this point of their belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt: They ſometimes look into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their lives, but never ſeriouſly conſider, whether the grace of converſion be ſhed abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts. They reſt in a civil, <hi>moral converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and do not throughly weigh whether they are made partakers of the <hi>ſpirit of regeneration.</hi> Whereas this is the fundamental evidence of our union with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his.</hi> That is, If he have not thoſe gracious qualifications which are infuſed into the ſoul by the spirit, in the work of converſion: If he have not his heart moulded anew, and faſhioned aright by the holy Ghoſt: If he have not the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord; which was the ſpirit that reſted upon Chriſt, he is none of his. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. This is <hi>firſtly,</hi> and <hi>fundamentally,</hi> to be enquired after, whether the work of converſion
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64514:198"/>be wrought upon us, and the grace of regeneration be formed in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. If a perſon would be inabled to take cognizance of himſelf, and to paſs a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon himſelf, whether he be converted, and ſo knit to Jeſus; <hi>He muſt of neceſſity, in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, be well inſtructed in the nature, and quality of converſion. My meaning is this,</hi> He muſt rightly underſtand wherein a ſound and ſincere conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion lieth, and what a change it maketh upon the ſoul, and what effects it produceth: that ſo he may not miſtake a <hi>feigned</hi> converſion, for a <hi>true;</hi> and a ſlight work upon the ſpirit, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked, for the grace of regeneration which is peculiar to the people of God.</p>
               <p>For <hi>mark it, Sirs,</hi> There is a falſe converſion as well as a true: and counterfeit grace, as well as that which is grace indeed, and in reality. As there is a feigned faith, and formal worſhip, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical obedience, ſo there is a counterfeit conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Her treacherous ſiſter</hi> Judah <hi>hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi> There is much deceit and treachery in this work; there may be a turning from ſin, when it is done in falſhood; there may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work upon the heart, that doth not amount to a ſaving change, or ſanctifying of the heart. <hi>As for inſtance.</hi> (1.) There may be a kind of abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and forſaking of <hi>ſome wicked wayes,</hi> to cleave the faſter unto <hi>others.</hi> A ſinner may ſhake off ſome kind of pride, to feed his covetouſneſs, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therewith: He may leave his profaneneſs, and become an Idolater or ſuperſtitious. As it was in the caſe of <hi>Micha,</hi> Judg. 17.2, 5. When his mother curſed and bann'd for her money that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64514:199"/>was ſtollen, this ſtartled his conſcience, and made him vomit up the ſweet morſel, which he had ſwallowed down. <hi>But the man</hi> Micah <hi>had an houſe of Gods, an made an Ephod, and a Teraphim.</hi> A ſinner may leave his worldlineſs, and become looſe and wanton: He may caſt off his open debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and become a ſecret oppoſer of the power of godlineſs. For <hi>as ſin is contrary to grace, and ſtriveth againſt it: ſo there are corruptions which are contrary to one another, and fight one againſt the other,</hi> Jam. 4.1. (2.) There is a kind of converſion from ſin, to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility: When a perſon leaveth his ſwearing, and drunkenneſs, and revelling, <hi>and the like;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a civil man, and of an ordinary external demeanour, but proceedeth no further, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.27, 28. (3) There may be an abandoning and caſting away many miſcarriages in the practiſe, when yet the heart ſtill hankereth after them; and were it not for ſome reſtraints of providence, would quickly ruſh into the actual commiſſion of them. What could have been ſpoken more like to a convert than that of <hi>Balaam?</hi> Numb. 24.13. <hi>If</hi> Balak <hi>would give me his houſe full of ſilver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine own mind: but what the Lord ſaith that will I ſpeak.</hi> When yet, he <hi>loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and fain would have curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. (4.) There may be a kind of converſion from ſin for the preſent, with a ſecret purpoſe of the heart to return to it again, in convenient ſeaſon. A ſinner may fall out with his luſts, and be filled with diſlike of them, for ſome preſent miſchief they have done him; when he is corrected for them, with an outward judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet the heart intend no total divorce,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64514:199"/>or ſeparation. <hi>Juſt as friends may fall out in a fit of paſſion; but when they are come to themſelves, they are eaſily reconciled again.</hi> As it was in the caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jer. 34.9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17. When the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> army fought againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Princes and people were in great diſtreſs, they turned and did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord: But when the diſtreſs was over, they returned back again to their ſins as faſt as ever. So it is with many carnal people when they are on their ſick beds: O how hot are they then againſt their ſins! and what a cry will they make, as if none were more filled with hatred againſt ſin! But when once the ſickneſs is over, <hi>they quickly repent of their repentance.</hi> See how far the people went in time of a deſtroying plague, when they were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour in jeopardy of their lives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35, 36. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him;</hi> that is, they prayed to him, and they lamented af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord; they poured out their ſupplications in the time of chaſtiſement. <hi>And they returned</hi>] that is, they left their ſins, and promiſed amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>poſſibly</hi> made ſolemn vows &amp; Covenants never to return to them again; if God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them but this once, they would ſerve him for ever. <hi>And they enquired early after God</hi>] that is, earneſtly and affectionately, as if they were eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon regaining his favour, and nothing would ſatisfie them without it: They enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, as if they had been ready to do whatſoever he ſhould command them. <hi>And they remembred that God was their rock, and the high God their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> So that this was not only a ſudden flaſh of their ſpirits, but a matter done upon ſome kind of deliberation: they were convinced that it was
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64514:200"/>beſt for them to ſerve the Lord, and they caſt off their ſins upon that conviction. And yet all was done but in hypocriſie, as it followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they did flatter him with their lips, and they lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if perſons be not rightly inſtructed, in the nature of a true converſion, and where the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is betwixt it, and this counterfeit work; it is impoſſible they ſhould rightly judge, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are truly converted. If they be not rightly informed of the nature of ſaving grace, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly determine, whether they are partakers of it. I am perſwaded that this is the original of the preſumption, and ſelf-deceit of many. <hi>They preſently conclude themſelves to be godly, becauſe they are not well inſtructed in the nature of godlineſs.</hi> They think that they have repented unto ſalvation, becauſe they know not wherein ſuch repentance doth conſiſt: they take the form of godlineſs, for the power of it; and a legal repentance, for evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. If they find ſome convictions and trouble in their ſpirits for ſin, they are preſently willing to believe it is a converſion from ſin: If there be found in their hearts ſome ſlight affections to the word, they apprehend themſelves to be ſavingly wrought upon by the word: If in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they leave ſome old ſins, and turn over a new leaf, they imagine themſelves to be new creatures. Whereas a ſaving converſion is another kind of matter; it maketh a change in the whole nature of the ſinner. It is not limited and confined to any particular faculties of the ſoul, but extendeth it ſelf to the renovation of the whole man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. It
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64514:200"/>doth not only ſet a man free from ſome groſſer acts of iniquity, which a natural conſcience will ſtartle at; but ſetteth up a ſtanding enmity in the ſoul againſt every falſe way, whether greater or leſſer, whether they be ſins of the fleſh or of the ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.104. And this enmity is a laſting, irreconcileable enmity, ſuch as ſhall never be rooted out again. It is not as the damming up of a ſtream with mounds and banks, which when they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it runneth the ſame way with as great a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as ever; but it is as the cleanſing of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and turning the water into another channel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. A ſound converſion doth not only turn the ſoul from ſin, but cauſeth him to return unto the Lord, <hi>even unto the Lord;</hi> and actually ingageth him in all the parts of his ſervice, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4, 1, 2. <hi>There is a kind of converſion from ſin, which is not a returning to the moſt High:</hi> when perſons take up their reſt in negative righteouſneſs, and abſtaining from ſome pollutions; but cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be in ſubjection to the whole government of Chriſt; they hate the poſitive part of Religion, which conſiſteth in a cloſs walking with God, and ſtudying in all things to approve themſelves unto him. A ſound converſion bringeth a man unto the Lord, that he may become his ſervant, and have his fruit unto holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. It is not every ſtrong conviction of the excellency of Religion, accompanied with ſome faint inclinations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to cloſe with it, that will amount to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving converſion: But in every reſpect it muſt be an univerſal work. <hi>For it is a turning of the whole man, from the whole ſervice of ſin, unto the whole obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the will of God, during the whole courſe of our lives.</hi> And this is a matter you muſt give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64514:201"/>to get right apprehenſions of: For <hi>if you erre in the premiſes, you will miſtake in the concluſion deduced from thoſe premiſes:</hi> If you know not wherein the nature of converſion and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſteth; you can never rightly paſs ſentence upon your ſelves, whether you are converted and regenerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. The third Rule of direction is this. <hi>That the grace of regeneration and converſion, which is the fundamental evidence of union with Chriſt, is not alwayes diſcerned in the firſt plantation of it into the ſoul;</hi> or if it be diſcerned, yet it may afterwards be called into queſtion, concerning its truth and ſavingneſs; <hi>and therefore for the finding out whether you have that grace, you muſt enquire into the fruits and effects which are produced thereby.</hi> You muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your works, to prove that you are made Gods workmanſhip; and ſearch into your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, that it may appear you are partakers of a ſound converſion. 'Tis the exerciſe of repentance in the life, that muſt manifeſt the grace of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance poured forth into the heart: and your walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wayes of new obedience, that muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence your being made new creatures. <hi>And the reaſon of it is,</hi> Becauſe it is not alwayes perceived in the firſt infuſion of grace into the ſoul: or at leaſt the ſinner may be in doubt, whether it be a ſaving work which he finds wrought within him. Although he find and feel a preſent change in his ſpirit; yet he may queſtion whether it be ſuch a change, as will ſpeake him a true Convert. So that the way to put it out of queſtion, is to examine our obedience, and practical holineſs, which is the natural product of the principle of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence it is that we are ſo often preſſed to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64514:201"/>try our works, and to obſerve what fruit we bring forth, in order to the knowledge of our ſpiritual eſtate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Little children, let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the devil.</hi> Again, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> You have many carnal perſons apt to boaſt of the integrity of their hearts. It is true, <hi>will they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,</hi> they live in a courſe of ſin, and neglect of duty, their lives are peſtered with divers ſorts of abominations: yea, but <hi>will they plead,</hi> our hearts are good, and we mean well, and we hope we may have grace within, as well as they who are more forward in Religion. <hi>Why</hi> mark it, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> this is a plain cheat you put upon your ſelves; If falſe teachers ſooth you up in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, do not hearken to them; they will but delude you to your deſtruction: For if your hearts be good, your lives will be anſwerable: If the grace of God be within you, it will guide your feet in the wayes of righteouſneſs: you muſt prove your converſion, by the holineſs of your converſation.</p>
               <p>So that this Rule of advice will be uſeful on both hands. 1. To overturn the preſumption of the wicked, when they boaſt of the ſincerity of their hearts. 2. For relief to the godly, when they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of their converſion. It is many times the ground of the hard thoughts they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning their ſpiritual eſtate, becauſe they never felt thoſe throws and pangs of the new birth, which ſome have felt: nor can they tell the time, when they were effectually called, and converted. <hi>Why</hi> remember <hi>Sirs,</hi> Although this change is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64514:202"/>unto ſome in the firſt workings of it; yet grace is planted in others <hi>imperceptibly.</hi> And therefore the proof of it depends upon the fruit you bring forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our father; q.d.</hi> You muſt prove the truth of your profeſſion of being the children of God, by walking as becometh his children. How will you make it appear, that you have the grace of repentance; unleſs your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations be anſwerable thereunto? As the root of a tree is hid in the earth, and is not ſeen with the eye; but if you would know what ſort the tree is of, you muſt look upon the fruit: ſo it is in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, The habits of grace themſelves <hi>(the root of the matter)</hi> are the hidden man of the heart; they lie deep within, and ſometimes their entrance is not diſcerned: and therefore you muſt examine by your works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work.</hi> And no wonder that we are required to judge ourſelves by this Rule; for according to our works Chriſt will judge us at the laſt day. When he cometh to gather all people before him, and to divide them into companies, according to their ſpiritual condition; ſuch as are members of his body into one company, and ſuch as are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to him into another; and to paſs an irrepeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſentence upon them, he will proceed upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence drawn from their works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Who will render to every man according to his works. To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth evil:
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64514:202"/>of the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt, and alſo of the Gentile.</hi> Rev. 20.13. <hi>And they were judged every man according to his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is <hi>the third Rule of Direction,</hi> That to prove your union with Chriſt, by your converſion; you muſt diligently obſerve and enquire into the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your converſation; what reſpect you have to the commandments of God. For 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Whoſo keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby we know that we are in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. In the examination of your wayes and works, as a proof of your converſion, and union with Chriſt thereupon, this muſt be carefully minded; <hi>That it is not the external diſcharge of ſome particular duties, will evidence a ſincere converſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: but a diligent ſearch muſt be made into the main bent of your ſpirits, as to the wayes of holineſs; and the whole tenour of your converſations muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered upon that account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, whether you make religion your buſineſs; and if it be the great deſign you drive on, to ſtudy to pleaſe the Lord, and to be accepted of him. It is not the workings of your ſpirits in a fit of affection, when your hearts are warmed by the word, or you are under the call of ſome awakening providence, that will prove you to be converts indeed; but the general ſcope and tendency of your lives: when godlineſs is the <hi>trade</hi> that you follow, and holineſs the <hi>high way</hi> wherein you travel. As the expreſſion is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8, 9. <hi>And a high way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs: the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe: the way-faring
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64514:203"/>men though fools ſhall not erre therein. No Lion ſhall be there, nor ſhall any ravenous beaſt go up thereupon, it ſhall not be found there: but the redeemed ſhall walk there.</hi> Mark it <hi>Sirs,</hi> Holineſs is the <hi>high way,</hi> where the ſervants of Chriſt take their journey. They do not only, now and then, make an excurſion into ſome acts of piety and godlineſs, when they are under convictions, <hi>and the like:</hi> But they ſpend their very life time in walking with God. As holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is <hi>a plain way,</hi> wherein the meaneſt Chriſtian may go on directly to heaven without danger of miſcarrying: Though he be of never ſo low parts and endowments; yet if his deſign be to fear the Lord, and to be bleſſed in the enjoyment of him, God hath chalked out the way ſo clearly, that he that runs may obſerve it. And as it is <hi>a ſafe way,</hi> wherein the Lord hath undertaken for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of travellers, againſt all dangers, and evil occurrents: So it is <hi>the great road</hi> wherein all the redeemed ones travel, from one end of the week to the other.</p>

                  <hi>My brethren,</hi> ſuch as are Chriſtians in good earneſt do not take up a garb of Religion for the Sabbath, and then lay it aſide the ſix dayes following: as men put on, and off, their beſt apparel: They do not put on a kind of ſeriouſneſs, in ſpiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; and live as Atheiſts and worldlings in their ſecular negotiations and affairs: They do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the performance of ſome particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties only, to ſtop the clamours of an awakened conſcience; and when that turn is ſerved, return to their vanity and wickedneſs: But they make the Lord their conſtant companion, and take holineſs as a clew of thread, that runs through all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and concernments, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20, 21. <hi>In
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64514:203"/>that day there ſhall be upon the bells of their horſes,</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to the Lord: <hi>and the pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the Altar: yea every pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be holineſs to the Lord of hoſts.</hi> In that day] that is, when God doth pour out plentifully of the ſpirit of grace, and waſh ſinners in the fountain ſet open for ſin and uncleanneſs; then they ſhall endeavour to be ſpiritual in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common and ordinary actions of their lives, and to be holy in all manner of converſation. As it is not ſome particular acts of ſin, into which a man falleth, through weakneſs, and the violence of temptations, that will prove the perſon offending to be wicked, and unconverted; but when he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in a courſe of ſin, and any ungodlineſs is the way wherein he goeth: So it is not the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome particular duties of Religion, unto which a man is carried by the force of a natural conſcience, will prove his converſion; but when holineſs is <hi>the high way</hi> wherein he travelleth, and the very buſineſs which he proſecuteth. This was <hi>Noah's</hi> evidence, that he was righteous and perfect in his generation; He did not only obey the voice of the Lord in ſome particulats, but he <hi>walked with God,</hi> Gen. 6.9. And <hi>Enoch</hi> had this teſtimony that he pleaſed God, for he walked with him for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years together; from one end of the year to the other. Compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22.</p>

That obedience which will evidence that you are regenerated, and converted by the Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo knit unto him; <hi>muſt not only be right for the matter wherein it doth conſiſt, but rightly qualified alſo for the manner, how it is diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tendered unto the Lord.</hi> It is not barely the

And <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſtudying of the word, to which the bleſſing is annexed? Is it <hi>ſuch</hi> a giving of alms, as hath the promiſe of acceptance? It is a good thing to run in the way of God's precepts: But do you ſo run that ye may obtain? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>the fifth Rule of Direction:</hi> That in the

Not an honouring him with the lips, and drawing neer to him with the mouth, when the heart is removed far from him: Not a ſerving him only by a kind of compulſion, under ſome terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehenſions of the judgments of God: not in a ſlothful, careleſs, and lukewarm manner, as if Religion were a wearineſs to us, and we had no mind to our work: But when we ſerve him aright, our hearts muſt be ingaged to approach unto him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21, 22. we muſt be <hi>fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. And our inward parts muſt be employed in the works of holineſs. When a

It muſt be ſuch obedience as is exerciſed in ſpiritual duties; as meditation on the word of the Lord, and frequent contemplation of the excellencies of God, adoring his Majeſty, and admiring his works, and ſetting the affections on things above; as well as in pleading the cauſe of holineſs, and openly walking in the profeſſion of it. It muſt carry us to ſuch works, as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the ſecret receſſes of the Spirit; and ſets us a ſtriving againſt ſuch corruptions, as are forged and fabricated in the ſpirit, which no eye can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but God and our own conſciences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all the filthineſs, both of the fleſh, and ſpirit.</hi> Rom. 8.5. <hi>They that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

When we are not only contented to be kept free from the acts of ſin, but do mourn and lament under the principle of ſin, and labour to deaden that principle. When we do not think it enough to do much for God, but fain would have our ſpirits transformed, every day more and more, into the image of God. <hi>Thus it will be, if you are converted.</hi> If a carnal perſon reſiſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he thinks his work is done; and is apt to glory in himſelf, as if the whole buſineſs were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched: But a convert layeth the ax to the root of the tree; he followeth the corrupt ſtream to the poyſonous fountain, whence it is derived; and nothing will ſatisfie him, but cleanſing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and taking revenge upon his luſts, that lodge within him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. <hi>Paul</hi>'s actual ſins cauſe him to have an eye upon his heart, by which he was turned aſide. <hi>I ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>another law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me into captivity unto the law of ſin, which is in my members.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In relation to the agent, or perſon obeying:</hi> that is, when a man doth conſecrate and devote his whole ſelf, both ſoul and body, to the keeping of Gods commandments; and doth his will, <hi>not only from the heart,</hi> but <hi>with the whole heart</hi> and ſpirit. When there is a concentrication, and conjunction of all the powers and faculties of the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the ſervice of the Lord: the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is apprehenſive of the mind of God, and the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> approveth the way of his precepts: the <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> run out in earneſt deſires to do, and delight in doing the will of God; the <hi>will</hi> is in a poſture of ready compliance therewith: the <hi>conſcience</hi> ſtirreth up unto obedience, and the <hi>members of the body</hi> are inſtruments in the execution of what is enjoyned. Contrary to that <hi>dividing heart,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemneth; when the ſeveral faculties of the ſoul draw ſeveral wayes: The underſtanding, and judgment, and conſcience are for God, and his wayes; but the will and the affections for ſin, and the world, and ſuch lying vanities: When perſons

This is the <hi>perfect heart</hi> which was a comfort to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> when all the ſoul goeth together in the way to heaven, and there

When a man's ſoul is drawn out in a deteſtation of every ſin, and doth not live in the allowed omiſſion, or neglect of any known duty; whether ſecret or publike, whether generally practiſed or deſpiſed by the generality.

That which is evidential thereof, muſt be ſuch obedience as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt: when you ſerve the Lord <hi>evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically,</hi> in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter: as the diſtinction is given us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But <hi>when is our obedience evangelical?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It mainly conſiſts in <hi>four things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When we are active and vigorous, in doing all that we can for God, <hi>and then account it as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to gain us acceptation with the Lord.</hi> When we are ſerviceable, in our places and duties, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, indeavouring to the uttermoſt the promotion of his intereſt; and then lay all that we have done at his feet; expecting our acceptance, &amp; reward, purely upon the account of his bloud. When we labour to be intent upon the works of perſonal righteouſneſs; and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwrite with our hearts, <hi>That we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> and lay the whole ſtreſs of our ſalvation upon the righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus. This is Goſpel-ſervice, when we lay all our ſacrifices upon the <hi>Goſpel-altar,</hi> that they may be ſanctified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and place no manner of confidence in what is done <hi>by us;</hi> but in the obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt <hi>for us, Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>For we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> As if he had ſaid, We labour to ſerve God in the pureſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and offer up unto him the beſt that we have; but then we dare not put the leaſt ſtreſs upon it, but all our confidence is in Chriſt; it is of him we boaſt, and not of our holineſs: We give all diligence <hi>in
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64514:209"/>point of performance,</hi> but are nothing in our ſelves <hi>in point of dependance:</hi> And <hi>we are the circumciſion,</hi> we are <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, who have our hearts cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. A legal frame of ſpirit goeth to God in duty, and then expects a bleſſing for his duties ſake: and thus a ſinner may toyl all his life time in a round of duty, and be very far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Then we obey <hi>evangelically,</hi> when we do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then is our obedience Goſpel-ſervice indeed, <hi>when it is performed in Goſpel ſtrength; i. e.</hi> not by our own abilities, but by vertue derived from Chriſt, and in an humble dependance upon the aſſiſtance of his Spirit. That is a legal way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when a perſon brings forth fruit unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and when he acts therein from himſelf: When he goeth in his own might, and power, to grapple with ſin, and ſtrive againſt temptations, and to keep the Law of God. But a Believer is <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might:</hi> and here is the evidence of a ſincere convert, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, you ſhall die: but if ye, through the ſpirit, do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Mark it, It is not ſaid, if you make reſolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and ſet againſt the workings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: But if you mortifie them <hi>through the ſpirit;</hi> then it is a ſign you are quickned and made alive by the holy Ghoſt, and that you ſhall live for ever in the preſence of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Evangelical obedience is that <hi>which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the evangelical pattern, viz.</hi> the life of Chriſt. When a Chriſtian doth ſtudy to be a follower of him, and to tread in his ſteps, and to imitate the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64514:210"/>Lord Jeſus, by endeavouring to write after the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py which he hath ſet before us, in doing and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God. This is the obedience which will evidence our union with him, and intereſt in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk even as he walked.</hi> He that ſaith he is in him] <hi>that is,</hi> He that ſaith ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as the matter is in reality: He that would not appear, to be a lyar in what he pretendeth to; and to boaſt of what he hath no ſaving intereſt in; muſt walk according to our Saviour's example.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Evangelical obedience is that <hi>which is tendered upon evangelical motives, and conſiderations.</hi> When we are diligent and induſtrious in the ſervice of God, becauſe our hearts are drawn forth in love towards him; and we are ſenſible of his goodneſs in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his only begotten Son, to die in the behalf of loſt ſinners; and in making known the myſtery of Chriſt unto us, and giving us promiſes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through him.

Yet he doth not ſerve the Lord <hi>meerly</hi> out of fear of his wrath: But the love of God doth conſtrain him, and his affections towards God are a forcible reſtraint to keep him from diſpleaſing the Lord, who hath been ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord, and his goodneſs in the latter dayes. i.e.</hi> Upon this very account they ſhall be cautious not to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, becauſe he hath dealt ſo bountifully
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64514:210"/>with them. This is the <hi>third qualification,</hi> it muſt be <hi>evangelical</hi> obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would prove your converſion and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, by the holineſs of your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and new obedience; you muſt look to it that it be <hi>ſincere obedience;</hi> done in the ſingleneſs and godly ſimplicity of your hearts. You muſt ſerve the Lord, as in the ſight of the Lord; and with a pure eye of reſpect unto the advancement of his glory; and in order to your bleſſedneſs in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him, and communion with him. For in thoſe two things doth conſiſt much of the nature of ſincerity. 1. <hi>In ſtudying to approve our ſelves in the ſight of God.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſeemeth to explain it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>As of ſincerity, as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>In ſerving the Lord for himſelf. My meaning is this;</hi> Then is a Chriſtian ſincere in his obedience, when he is not acted therein by fleſhly wiſdom, nor doth make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubſervient to any carnal ends: But he hath a ſingle eye of regard to the glory of God, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining fellowſhip with him, and the ſecuting his own intereſt in the Lord, as a portion for his ſoul. When he is carried on to the works of holineſs, by ſpiritual arguments: he doth that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, out of reſpect to the commandment; or <hi>[eo nomine]</hi> for that very reaſon, becauſe it is the commandment of the Lord, and his heart ſtands in awe of it. This alone is to ſerve the Lord in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will. Elſe, if you ſet upon a courſe of Religion for any ſecular advantage that cometh by it, you do but ſerve your ſelves by Religion. As it is ſaid of the Schiſmaticks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>They that are ſuch ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly.</hi> They pretended Chriſt, but deſigned
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64514:211"/>themſelves. And ſo do hypocrites of all ſorts; they ſerve not God by their works of piety, but their own profit and advancement in the word;

                     <hi>Chriſt-merchants and Chriſt-huckſters,</hi> as one calls them.</note> they ſerve their own credit and reputation, and the furtherance of ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt: or perhaps they may ſerve their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry luſts, and make proviſion for them, by the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion. So the <hi>whore</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> Chap. 7.14, 15. She paid her vows, and offered peace-offerings, that ſhe might purchaſe a licenſe to ſin more freely. <hi>Thus multitudes of people debaſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> They go on in a conſtant road of outward performances, that at other times they may take the greater liberty, and ſin with leſſer diſturbance in their ſpirits. But now a ſincere Chriſtian ſerves the Lord himſelf, in all the parts of his obedience. As he is ſpiritual in the diſcharge of his work; ſo the reaſons and motives are ſpiritual, whereby he is ſtirred up unto the diſcharge of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here is a main ground of the univerſality of a believers obedience;</hi> becauſe ſpiritual reaſons are comprehenſive of the whole will of God, whereas carnal motives and arguments have but a partial influence. <hi>A little to clear it by inſtances.</hi> If you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſin, becauſe of the ſhame of the world; that will only help to preſerve you from open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but will have no influence againſt ſecret pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which the world cannot obſerve: If you perform duty to pleaſe a party, or to get ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral benefit; <hi>that</hi> will only ingage you in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of ſuch duties as are countenanced by them, and are pleaſing in their eye; but will no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail as to the practiſe of ſuch as are contemned and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64514:211"/>deſpiſed. But <hi>now</hi> if you obey the will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his will; <hi>That</hi> will enforce an obedience to all

And here is the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that will prove the work of regeneration; and miniſter joy thereupon; <hi>When in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. When we do not <hi>truck</hi> with Religion, nor make it a <hi>ſtalking-horſe</hi> in ſubordination to any baſe or corrupt ends: But what we do, is done in a meaſure, in a ſingleneſs of ſpirit, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of our hearts; as mainly indeavouring therein to to be accepted of God.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>fourth property</hi> of evidential obedience, It muſt be <hi>ſincere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It muſt be <hi>thriving obedience,</hi> and of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing nature: for ſanctifying grace is of a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nature.

It is to be feared that many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſlightly upon the work of ſelf-examination, and quickly ſlubber it over in a carleſs and ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner: and that is the very reaſon why they never bring matters to an iſſue, or determinate concluſion in this caſe. For it is a work to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the greateſt cautelouſneſs, diligence, and deliberation: and with earneſt prayer to the Lord, that he may diſcover to us thoſe intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and labyrinths, wherein our guilful ſpirits are apt to hide themſelves. This is <hi>the ſeventh Rule of Advice.</hi>

Mind this word of counſel <hi>in the laſt place;</hi> That if a perſon upon the moſt ſerious and deliberate examination of himſelf be ſtill left in the dark, as to his union with Chriſt, for want of clear evidences of his converſion; <hi>The way to make ſure work in this behalf, and to put the matter out of queſtion, is to put forth immediately freſh acts of faith
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:64514:214"/>upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for ſalvation; to renew his repentance as to the evil of ſin; to make a freſh ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of himſelf into the hands of God, upon the terms of the Covenant of grace; and to enter preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the courſe of new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

               <p>Theſe <hi>Sirs,</hi> are thoſe acts, which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of regeneration doth firſt exert, and put forth, when it is planted into the ſoul: and theſe ſpiritual acts are often reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and repeated, by the ſouls of ſuch as are converted. So that if you were before effectually called, theſe will be the renewings of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: and if you were formerly unconverted, yet hereby it will be evident that you continue ſuch no longer: But that, <hi>through grace,</hi> now the work is wrought: Theſe being the immediate products of the grace of converſion. I will a little open <hi>this word of Advice,</hi> in relation to each of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars aſunder.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Act your faith [afreſh] upon the Lord Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs.</hi> Endeavour in the ſenſe of the greatneſs of the evil of your ſins, and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inſupportableneſs of the wrath of God, deſerved by ſin; in the due acknowledgment of the juſtice of God that muſt be ſatisfied, and the inſufficiency of all your perſonal qualifications and obedience to give ſatisfaction thereunto; to caſt your ſelves upon Chriſt's righteouſneſs, to put your ſelves for redemption into his hands, and to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64514:215"/>accept him for your Saviour, upon the terms of the Goſpel. <hi>This is to believe in Jeſus;</hi> and if it be done <hi>now</hi> in ſincerity and truth, it will be a comfortable evidence, that either you were formerly united unto Chriſt, or elſe that at the preſent the knot is tyed betwixt him, and your ſouls. See the words of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.46. <hi>I am come as a light into the world, that whoſoever believeth on me, ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi> Only take the advice with this <hi>proviſe;</hi> See to it that you do not miſtake in the nature of faith: that you do not take a <hi>dead faith,</hi> for <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:</hi> nor an hypocritical counterfeit faith, for the faith of God's elect. And then if you believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the putting forth that principle into exerciſe, will be as a preſent evidence that you are gotten into Chriſt, and have a right to the favour of God through his bloud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To put the matter out of queſtion, touching your converſion, and union with Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your repentance, as to the evil of ſin.</hi> Labour to get ſuch a ſight of your tranſgreſſions committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, as may fill you with godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them: and to be ſo deeply affected with your own filthineſs and pollutions, that you may loath your ſelves, and lie down in your ſhame, upon the account of that filthineſs: Upon taſte of the bitterneſs of your departings from God, and the deſtructive nature of your iniquities, let your hearts be ſet in hatred of them, and caſt them away from you with utter deteſtation, and abhorrence, never to come neer you again, as to any reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them: Eſpecially abhor thoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have moſtly prevailed over you, ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your luſts, <hi>get ye hence, what have I to do any more
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:64514:215"/>with you? You have ruined my ſoul, and I will never yield ſubjection to you further. If I have ſerved you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, through Gods aſſiſtance I will do it no longer.</hi> This, <hi>my brethren,</hi> is repentance according to the Scriptures. And if your hearts ſpeak theſe things in uprightneſs, it will help to demonſtrate that you have the grace of repentance, and ſo ſhall never come into condemnation. Only take heed that your hearts do not diſſemble and flatter in this work, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19. <hi>After I was turned, I repented; and after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh.</hi> Firſt <hi>Ephraim</hi> was made partaker of the grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and then he doth exerciſe that grace in a ſincere repentance. Indeed <hi>a legal repentance</hi> may be without grace in the heart; but this <hi>evangelical repentance</hi> is the product of grace and an evidence thereof. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To prove that you are converted, <hi>Make a freſh ſurrender of your ſelves into the hands of God, upon the articles of the Covenant of grace.</hi> Reſign up your ſelves <hi>anew</hi> unto the moſt High; make choice of him for your only portion, ſet your affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as the chiefeſt good, and give up your ſelves unreſervedly to be his ſervants, and to be wholly at his diſpoſal. That is another ſpiritual act which the principle of regeneration doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put forth, when it is infuſed into the ſoul; and if you perform it in the integrity of your hearts, it will be an evidence that you are partakers of that principle, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3, 5. <hi>I will pour out water upon him that is thirſty, and flouds upon the dry ground: I will pour out my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring.</hi> And then it followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords: and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of</hi> Jacob: <hi>and another ſhall ſubſcribe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:64514:216"/>with his hand unto the Lord, and firname himſelf by the name of Iſrael.</hi> Mark it, Aſſoon as the Spirit of God is put into the ſoul, that ſoul doth give up himſelf unto God, and liſt himſelf amongſt his followers. So that as a preſent proof of your having the ſpirit of converſion, take your hearts along with you, and go to the Lord, and make a full and freſh refignation of them, and of your whole ſelves into his hands. <hi>Take with you words and go unto the Lord,</hi> as it is elſewhere expreſſed. <hi>My meaning is this.</hi> (1.) Take with you words of <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>choice;</hi> ſay unto him, O Lord, I now take thee to be my God and my Maſter, I will hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward make thee my refuge and fortreſs, I will ſet my heart upon thee as my only happineſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward: If I have ſtood it out for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly againſt the tenders of grace, I will ſtand out no more: If I have followed after lying vanities, I will follow them no longer: Now I make choice of the Lord, Behold I come unto thee, for thou art my God, and I abandon all things that ſtand in competition with thee. This ſort of words you ſhall meet with, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23. (2.) Take with you words of <hi>ſurrender,</hi> and <hi>ſay unto God,</hi> O Lord, here I am to dedicate my ſelf, and my ſtrength, and my time, and my talents, to the doing of thy will, and the advancement of thy glory: If hitherto I have ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, now I will ſerve my God, even him only: If I have for the former part of my life trampled upon thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; now I will devote my ſelf wholly to thy fear, and to the keeping thy ſtatutes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.38. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. And (3.) Take with you words of <hi>prayer and ſupplication,</hi> and <hi>ſay unto him,</hi> Lord, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me graciouſly, and love me freely, and admit
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:64514:216"/>me again into thy ſervice: It is true, that I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy to have the leaſt regard from the God of heaven; but I come unto thee through Chriſt, who is worthy. I beſeech thee mercifully to inrol me amongſt the number of thy peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Hoſ</hi> 14.1, 2. And <hi>my brethren,</hi> if you do thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly give up your ſelves unto God, it will be a preſent teſtimony that you are alive from the dead, that you are quickned by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To put this matter of your converſion out of queſtion, <hi>Make an immediate entrance upon a courſe of new obedience.</hi> Set now upon cleanſing your ſelves further from all ſorts of filthineſs, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform thoſe duties, which in your places and ſtations are to be performed; and therein ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to approve your ſelves unto God. If thine heart be privy to any corruption, that hath been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced; let it be wholly forſaken, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſin avoided. If any wicked companion hath had too much of thy converſe and intimacy, now break off ſociety with him. If any duty hath been omitted, let it be henceforward diſcharged; if ſlightly performed, let it be done in an humble, ſerious, and ſpiritual manner. Hereby it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that you gave up your ſelves to be the Lord's in ſincerity: that you do not complement only with him, as many Profeſſors do, who are often profeſſing and proteſting to the Lord that they are his ſervants, but ſtill they follow the imaginations of their own hearts. Then is the reſignment of our ſelves unto the Almighty done <hi>in truth,</hi> when it doth ingage us preſently to walk <hi>in the truth. I have ſworn</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>and I will perform it, that I
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64514:217"/>will keep thy righteous judgments,</hi> Pſal. 119.106. And ſuch is the language of a true Convert; <hi>I am the Lord's, and now I will demean my ſelf as being his: I have given my ſelf to the moſt High, and now I will be no more at my own diſpoſal: I have ſubſcribed unto the Lord, and accordingly I am doing his work.</hi> So that here is <hi>the laſt word of advice,</hi> for the preſent proof of your converſion, and union with Chriſt thereupon: <hi>Yield up your ſelves unto the Lord; and ſerve the Lord your God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. Make a preſent entrance, in the ſtrength of the Spirit, upon all the wayes of holineſs; and let that be your conſtant exerciſe, from henceforth unto the end.</p>
               <p>Thus I have finiſhed <hi>the ſecond uſe of the point,</hi> by way of <hi>examination</hi> and <hi>trial.</hi>

For they are one with him; <hi>ſo that he that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye, Zech.</hi> 2.8. Chriſt hath a tender regard unto them, and is ſenſible of the ſmalleſt injury that is done unto them; as we are of the leaſt blow or prick upon the apple of the eye. <hi>Sirs,</hi> It is the ſorrieſt office imaginable, to be a Perſecutor of the Saints: it is the worſt imployment upon earth,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:64514:218"/>to ſet againſt believers: for they are one with Chriſt, and ſo in effect it is to fight againſt him.

And is it not a dangerous thing to ſet againſt Chriſt? If he plead againſt you, who ſhall maintain your cauſe before the Lord? If thou make him thine adverſary, who ſhall be thy friend? If Chriſt ſentence thee to hell, for oppoſing his members; who ſhall be able to ſave thee from thence? If you do but touch the Saints to their hurt, you will burn your fingers by it; <hi>nay,</hi> you will ruine your ſouls for ever, without a ſpeedy repentance; for they are one with Jeſus.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Exhortation</hi> may fitly be branched forth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>four particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Do not ſcandalize, or offend the ſervants of God.</hi> See to it, that you be not guilty of laying ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks in their way. Be careful, what in you lieth, that you do not grieve their ſpirits, nor ſadden their hearts, by your diſorderly walking. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially take heed that you lay none occaſions of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64514:218"/>in their way, (which is the offence that the holy Ghoſt
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Illud ſcandalum dicitur ubi recto itinere ambulanti deceptie aliqua inſtruitur ad peccandum,</hi> Orig.</note> moſtly warneth againſt) for they are knit to Chriſt. It is the very argument preſſed for prevention of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 12. <hi>Take heed leſt by any means this liberty of yours become a ſtumbling block to them that are weak.</hi> For as it followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>When ye ſin ſo againſt the brethren, and wound their weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ye ſin againſt Chriſt.</hi> How againſt him? <hi>Why,</hi> not only againſt the word and commandment of Chriſt, which is hereby contemned; <hi>ſo all ſins are againſt him:</hi> not only againſt the work of Chriſt, which you hereby oppoſe; (Chriſts work is to ſave theſe weak Chriſtians, and what in you lieth, by your ſcandals you put an obſtacle in the way of their ſalvation:) But you ſin eſpecially againſt Chriſt, becauſe they are his members, knit unto him, and made one with him. So that, <hi>my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> the matter of ſcandalizing and offending the meaneſt of the Saints of the moſt High; is not of ſuch trivial concernment, as many perſons would make it. When they are preſſed with an argument drawn from this <hi>Topick</hi> of offending the ſervants of God, they turn it off with a wet finger, as if it were a matter hardly worth the mentioning. But <hi>Sirs,</hi> is it nothing to ſin againſt Chriſt, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Is it nothing to deſtroy thoſe for whom he died, and who are in him? ſure I am, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf putteth much weight upon it, and reckons it amongſt the ſins that he will ſeverely puniſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, which believe in me, it were better for him
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64514:219"/>that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Do not reproach or ſpeak evil of the people of God.</hi> Dare not to vent a contemptuous, or malicious word againſt them; for they are one with Chriſt; and ſo whatſoever is ſpoken againſt them, doth not only reflect upon him, but is accounted as ſpoken againſt him, <hi>Jude</hi> 15. <hi>Behold the Lord cometh, with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly amongſt them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed; and of all their hard ſpeeches, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> How do they ſpeak againſt him? <hi>Not only</hi> when they openly blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the name of Chriſt, and utter deſpiteful words againſt the perſon of Chriſt: But when they reproach his people, and vent their hatred in evil words againſt his Saints. This is reckoned as done againſt Chriſt, becauſe of their near relation unto him, and union with him. Commonly their hard ſpeeches are immediately directed againſt Believers, Many that pretend a love to Chriſt, or that will not be ſo profane as to ſpeak reproachfully of him, will be often laſhing at his followers, and taking all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to ſmite them with the tongue, and to caſt dirt upon their profeſſion. But <hi>mark it Sirs,</hi> how little ſoever you think of it; this is to ſtrike at Chriſt, and to wound him through their loyns: And in the day of accounts, he will convince you of theſe hard ſpeeches; he will make you to know, to your eternal ſorrow, what an evil it was thus to wrong his people. For it is <hi>for the Son of mans ſake</hi> that the godly are reproached, and their name is caſt out as evil: And <hi>beſides,</hi> he dwelleth in them, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64514:219"/>they are one with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.22. So that you ſhould be afraid to ſpeak evil of them. As the Lord ſaid to <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> Num. 12.8. <hi>Wherefore were ye not afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant Moſes? q. d.</hi> He is my ſervant, one of my family, and what he doth is in my name; I the Lord employ him in the work that he hath undertaken; and could you imagine that I would not take his part? or that I would not ſtand up in his vindication and defence? So may the Lord Jeſus ſay to you in this reſpect: This people, whom you deſpiſe and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon, are my people; you account them as the dung of the earth, and the off ſcouring of all things, and at every turn are ready to caſt dirt in their faces; But they are of my retinue, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto me, nay they are <hi>myſtically one with me:</hi> and could you think I would not riſe up in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half? Wherefore were you not afraid, to ſpeak a word againſt them? you do thereby eaſt diſhonour upon Chriſt, and load him with your reproaches, <hi>for they are his members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Have not the leaſt hand in perſecuting, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally oppoſing the people of God.</hi> Do not hinder their progreſs in the wayes of holineſs, nor be a means to bring them into ſufferings, upon that account. <hi>Remember,</hi> They are one with Chriſt the Saviour; and if he ſhut the door of heaven againſt you, who can open it for your admittance? <hi>He hath the key of</hi> David, <hi>that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> They are united to Chriſt, the <hi>Judge;</hi> and what favour can you expect at his hands, if you ſet your ſelves in defiance againſt him? But <hi>you will ſay,</hi> we do not meddle with Chriſt; far be it from us to act in the leaſt againſt him: We only puniſh, and ſet againſt, a company
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64514:220"/>of inconſiderable people, that walk in a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary to the reſt of the world; who have a path by themſelves, and would be deemed more holy than their neighbours: <hi>If Chriſt were upon earth, we would honour and ſerve him.</hi> But <hi>Sirs,</hi> be not deceived, God is not mocked: If you hate believers for their holineſs, you would much more have hated Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe holineſs is unſpeakably more than theirs; and you would perſecute him, if he were within your reach: for he walked more preciſely and ſtrictly than any of the poor Chriſtians, whom you oppoſe; and in a far greater contradiction to the world. <hi>Beſides,</hi> what you do againſt them, is interpreted as done againſt Chriſt himſelf; becauſe they are one with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecutoſt thou me?

                  <hi>Conſ.</hi> 1. Holy men and women who ſtudy to pleaſe the Lord, and to walk in integrity before him, <hi>are the very pillars of a Nation, by which it is upheld.</hi> They are the main props and ſupporters of the places where they live, &amp; of the families where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they dwell. It is for their ſakes, that mercies are continued unto a people, or kingdom; and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are kept off from falling down upon them, to their utter deſolation and ruine. So that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you to ſeek their good, and to incourage them in their holineſs, as you tender your own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Were it not for the ſervants of Chriſt, you would quickly be in a miſerable caſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God doth gather his own people unto himſelf, it is uſually the forerunner of ſome ſore calamity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> Plainly intimating, that it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:64514:221"/>was their preſence which ſtaved off vengeance for a time; and when they are called home, then the floud-gates of wrath are ſet open. It is upon their account that God doth reſtrain the wickedneſs of men, that they are not as monſters, and devils one to another; and that he doth with-hold the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his wrathful indignation. You know, what he ſaith in relation to <hi>Sodom,</hi> whoſe ſin was grievous, and the cry of it was great, and went up to heaven; yet, if there had been ten righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it, the place had been ſpared for their ſakes: And however, nothing could be done againſt it, till righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was gone forth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.32. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>ſometimes the wickedneſs of a place is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively heinous, that it is beyond the prayers of the godly.</hi> The moſt eminent perſons in holineſs ſhall not prevail for the ſparing it. <hi>Though</hi> Noah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in it, they ſhall deliver but their own ſouls by their righteouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 14.13, 14. Yet, in many caſes, they are inſtrumental by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and prayers, not only to deliver themſelves, but to keep off vengeance from others. And will you root them out, who are the means of your preſervation? You think they are theſe <hi>preciſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> who ſpeak ſo much of Religion, and are more ſtrict than others, that hinder your mirth, and jollity. What brave times of pleaſure ſhould you have, were it not for theſe Preciſians, who are as thornes in your ſides, and rubs in the way of your rejoycings, and merriment? But <hi>Sirs,</hi> if you believe the Scriptures, it is evident, that were it not for the godly amongſt you, you might ſoon expect to fall under the ſaddeſt diſpenſations, and to have the ſluces of the fury of the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:64514:222"/>ſet wide open upon you. As ſoon as <hi>Noah</hi> was arkt, the floud ſwept away the world of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. As ſoon as <hi>Lot</hi> was lodg'd in <hi>Zoar,</hi> it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fire and brimſtone (<hi>as it were,</hi> hell from heaven) upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gemorrah.</hi> And mark what our Saviour ſpeaketh of Goſpel-times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.22. <hi>Except thoſe dayes ſhould be ſhortened, there ſhould no fleſh be ſaved. But for the elects ſake thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortened.</hi> Were it not upon the account of the ſervants of God, who are converted, and ſuch as hereafter are to be converted; the tribulation would prove like a ſweeping rain, that leaveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind it. So that it concerns you in point of wiſdom to love and cheriſh the Saints, and to take heed that they be not wronged: For they are <hi>the beſt ſubjects</hi> in a Kingdom; <hi>the beſt neighbours</hi> in the places where they abide; <hi>the beſt relations</hi> and <hi>ſervants,</hi> you can get into your families; they bring the bleſſing of heaven along with them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.5. They are <hi>the beſt friends</hi> you can have, for they will be friends to your ſouls. So that I may allude to that paſſage of the Lord to <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech, Gen.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Reſtore the man his wife, for he is a Prophet, and ſhall pray for thee and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Shew kindneſs to the godly, for they are favourites in the Court of heaven, intimately acquainted with God; <hi>yea,</hi> united to Chriſt the Son of God; They will pray for thee, and be inſtrumental to avert and turn away judgments from thee, and to bring down bleſſings upon thy head; if not to ſave thy precious and immortal ſoul.</p>

Poſſibly, he may grant them a little out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity for a while, but at length he will break in upon them, as the breaking in of mighty waters; and will take them away as a whirlwind, both living and in his wrath. It is a ſhrewd ſign that God hath determined to deſtroy them, who devour his people, and conſult againſt his hidden ones. See what dreadful threatnings are denounced againſt <hi>Edom</hi> upon this very ſcore, <hi>Obad.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not have looked on the day of thy brother, in the day that he became a ſtranger; neither ſhouldeſt thou have rejoyced over the children of</hi> Judah <hi>in the day of their deſtruction; neither ſhouldeſt thou have ſpoken prondly in the day of their diſtreſs, &amp;c.</hi> And then it followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>As thou haſt done, ſo ſhall it be done unto thee, thy reward ſhall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, ſo ſhall all the Heathen drink continually, yea, they ſhall drink and ſwallow down, and they ſhall be as though they had not been. But upon mount</hi> Zion <hi>there ſhall be deliverance, and there ſhall be holineſs, and the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall poſſeſs their poſſeſſions. And the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall be a fire, and the houſe of</hi> Joſeph <hi>a flame, and the houſe of</hi> Eſau <hi>for ſtubble; and they ſhall kindle in them and devour them, and there ſhall not be any remaining of the houſe of</hi> Eſau: <hi>for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Read alſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34. the whole Chapter. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed was pluckt as a firebrand out of this burning; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:64514:223"/>unto the Lord in the very heat of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but it is mentioned as a wonderful act of grace, as exceeding abundant mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14, 16.

See how he makes their caſe his own, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.42, 43, 44, 45. <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> Pray <hi>mind it Sirs,</hi> What anſwer could you make againſt ſuch a charge, in the great and notable lay of the Lord? What apology could you plead for your ſelves, that you oppoſed Chriſt, and neglict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give him relief? What reaſon could you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, why you ſhould not be ſentenced to hell for it? If Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>I walked in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and you hated me for it; I was much in prayer and converſe with the godly, and you turned it into my reproach? I durſt not run as others to exceſs of riot, and you were filled with rage and madneſs againſt me:</hi> What defence could you make to acquit your ſelves from this charge? Perhaps you would deny the charge, <hi>and ſay,</hi> we never ſet againſt Chriſt; far be it from us to deſpiſe the Lord Jeſus; we love him and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with all our hearts: only we now and then trampled upon a few hot-ſpirited people, who were more nice than wiſe, and more ſtrict than
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:64514:223"/>they needed, and cried out againſt out ſins, and corruptions. But when did we ſpurn at Jeſus Chriſt? When did we ſee the Son of God, and did not miniſter unto him? <hi>Why Sirs,</hi> this is the very plea which the reprobates will make, at that day; but ſee how our Saviour will reject and over-rule their plea, upon this very ground; Becauſe he and his Saints are united, and what is done unto them, is as if it were done perſonally unto Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, Verily I ſay unto you, in as much as ye did it not unto one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not unto me.</hi> Your deſpiſing them is a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing Chriſt. So that conſider what will be the end of all your contempt and oppreſſions of the godly, but to periſh for ever? For mark the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels; q.d.</hi> Now you ſerve the devil herein, and hereafter you ſhall have your portion with the devil, and his angels.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>My brethren,</hi> It is a matter which neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, to make a diligent enquiry into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our hopes of eternal life; and to ſee what are the foundations upon which they are bottomed; whether they are built upon the ſand, or upon a rock. Many poor ſouls are undone for ever, for want of making this enquiry: they have ſtrong hopes and expectations of being ſaved, but are able to produce no reaſon of their hopes; or elſe they build their confidence upon ſuch rotten grounds, as will not miniſter a ſufficient reaſon for cheriſhing ſuch hopes; and ſo they go on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, till they drop into hell, ere they are aware of it. Now therefore for the prevention of ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in the entertainment of your hopes, ſee that you do not ſwerve from this general Rule; <hi>That there is no priviledge which may be ſeparated from the grace of union with Chriſt, or that is to be found in any perſons, which have not the Son, that can be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for hopes of eternal life. All ſuch founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are but ſandy foundations,</hi> and therefore do not reſt upon them. It is <hi>Chriſt in you which is the hope of glory.</hi> Col. 1.27. If the Lord Jeſus have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up his reſidence in you, by the workings of the holy Ghoſt, and if you are not implanted into him; all your hopes of ſalvation will vaniſh, and come to nothing, whatever other foundations you build upon.</p>

But, <hi>mind it Sirs,</hi> theſe things may be <hi>without having the Son,</hi> which is of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable neceſſity to eternal life.

You read of the <hi>children of the Kingdom caſt into outer darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 8.12. And <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature,</hi> Gal. 6.15. Circumciſion is put, <hi>by a Synochdoche,</hi> for all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, into which that Ordinance was an inlet: Theſe will never ſave you from hell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you be ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, and ſo implanted into him. When the Lord cometh to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:64514:225"/>execute judgment upon the ungodly, he will bind the Heathen and unſanctified Church-members in the ſame bundle together, and caſt them into the lake of fire. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>He will puniſh the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with the uncircumciſed;</hi> Egypt, <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Edom, <hi>and the children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and</hi> Moab, <hi>and all that are in the utmoſt corners, that dwell in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: For all theſe nations are uncircumciſed, and all the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are uncircumciſed in the heart.</hi> Church-priviledges if not rightly improved, will be as oyl to make the flames of hell fire burn hotter upon thee; But they will avail nothing to ſave thee from hell, except thou be married unto Chriſt, the head of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Great meaſures of the knowledge of the will of God, and an inſight into the doctrines revealed in the Scriptures, are a ſandy foundation, whereupon to build your hopes of eternal life.</hi> For they are to be found in perſons, that were never ingraffed into Chriſt. A man may know much of the doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, when yet he never was taught the truth, as it is in Jeſus.

He may diſcourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly to the edification of others, of ſuch myſteries of godlineſs, as he never felt the power of in himſelf. He may know many things touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son, that never learnt of the Father, ſo as to be drawn unto the Son. And indeed all the knowledge of hypocrites is no knowledge in Gods account, and will only ſerve to double the ſtripes

The holy Ghoſt doth obſerve it as the great obſtacle and impediment, in the way of ſalvation, that ſinners do not caſt off their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hopes: they ſee their miſery by ſin, but have ſecret thoughts in their hearts that they ſhall have peace notwithſtanding, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy way, yet thou ſaidſt not there is no hope: thou haſt found out the life of thine hand, therefore thou waſt not grieved.</hi> Mark it, here was the reaſon of their continuance in ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they retained their preſumptuous hopes: They did bolſter up themſelves in ſome groundleſs confidence of eſcaping, notwithſtanding their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence.

Why <hi>man,</hi> It is the deſign of our Miniſtry to drive thee to utter deſpair of ever being ſaved, without the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and of being ſaved by Chriſt, except you are united to him, and made ſpiritually one with him. We would not have you <hi>deſpair</hi> of finding mercy with the Lord, if you repent and be converted, and give up your ſelves to the Son of God, upon the terms of the Goſpel: But it is that which we drive at to cauſe you wholly to deſpair, and to caſt off all hopes of being ſaved by the Son, except you have the Son. <hi>This deſpair</hi> will awaken you out of your ſecurity, and make you reſtleſs in ſpirit till you have gotten into the City of refuge: It will make you earneſt in prayer unto God, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hard after him, with a vigorous and unwearied importunity, till he hath brought you unto Chriſt, and ingraffed you into him.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I am fallen upon this argument; wherein many poor ſouls are deluded, <hi>who live in the common practiſe of ſin, but will thank God they do not deſpair;</hi> not conſidering that a deſpair of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:64514:230"/>ſaved in an unconverted eſtate, is one of the firſt ſteps leading to converſion: I will therefore take the liberty to enlarge a little upon this head, by ſhewing you wherein the rock of deſpair is indeed dangerous, and to be avoided; and wherein, <hi>on the other hand,</hi> we are bound to deſpair, and to caſt off all hope, that we may diligently proſecute the things that concern our peace. And this I will do by giving you <hi>five Scripture Theſes, or Aſſertions</hi> touching this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the mercy of God, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of humble penitent and believing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is infinitely great, even as his nature and eſſence, and it is an attribute which he taketh ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial delight in the exerciſe of. So that there is no cauſe of deſpair, for the moſt heinous offendors, of finding grace and compaſſion with the Lord, if they return unto him in ſincerity. <hi>Though their ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made white as ſnow; and though they be red like crimſon</hi> [of the deepeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and aggravated with the moſt greatning cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances] <hi>they ſhall be as wool,</hi> Iſa. 1.18. Haſt thou played the harlot with many lovers? <hi>yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto me, ſaith the Lord, Jer.</hi> 3.1. Have thy ſins reached unto the Heavens? <hi>yea,</hi> but the mercy of God is above the heavens, being unſearchable as himſelf; for his compaſſions are himſelf: He is a God of mercy, his nature and eſſence is made up of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.12. Haſt thou multiplyed thine abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, above what can be reckoned? <hi>Why,</hi> his compaſſions are more than can be numbred. <hi>Let the wicked for ſake his wayes, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him: and to our God, for he will multiply to pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55.7. But can it ever
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:64514:230"/>enter into the heart of a man to think, that God will ever pardon ſuch a wretch as I have been, <hi>may the ſinner ſay?</hi> Mind what followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 8. He is God and not man, his mercies are not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by our ſcantling. <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your wayes my wayes, ſaith the Lord: For as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my wayes higher than your wayes, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The death and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, which he underwent for ſatisfaction of the juſtice of God, are of infinite value, and have given plenary content and ſatisfaction: and he is at the right hand of the Father to plead that ſatisfaction in the behalf of loſt ſinners. So that there is no ground of deſpair in this reſpect; as if they might be greater offenders, than the blood of Jeſus could purchaſe acceptance for. <hi>He is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, Heb.</hi> 7.25. and there is nothing beyond the uttermoſt. If you periſh for ever, it is not for want of merit in the death of Chriſt; for it was the death of that perſon, <hi>who is the eternal God, Act.</hi> 20.28. It was the death of the man, <hi>who was God's fellow, Zech.</hi> 13.7. The Father hath accepted of the price that he paid; <hi>In him he is well pleaſed,</hi> fully contented as to all the demands of his juſtice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. So that if you addreſs your ſelves unto Chriſt, and to God by him, you may come with a full aſſurance of faith; without doubting of acceptance, though your ſins have been never ſo great, and your condition never ſo deplorable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 22. <hi>That's the ſecond thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi>
               </p>

So that there is no reaſon to deſpair of Chriſt's willingneſs to become thy Redeemer. Here is that at which poor ſinners are apt to ſtick. Alas, <hi>will they ſay,</hi> We queſtion not the ſufficiency of his merit, but will he ever vouchſafe to undertake the patronage and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a rebel as I have been? Nay, but <hi>O man,</hi> art thou willing to accept him for thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Maſter, and to follow his conduct, and to become his Diſciple indeed? <hi>Why,</hi> he is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more willing to receive thee into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.

What brought <hi>Judas</hi> to deſpair, but forcing down the dictates of his own light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?

Be much in prayer to God for this very mercy, that he would graciouſly ſend the Spirit of his Son into your ſouls. There is an encouraging word to draw forth your fervent ſupplications in this behalf, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more ſhall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> It is the mercy which he delights to be ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for, and to be dealing forth, in return to the prayers of his Servants. 2. Be much converſant with the word of Chriſt, and conſtant in your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the Ordinances of the Goſpel. Be frequent in reading and ſtudying the Scriptures, make them the matter of your daily meditations; loſe no opportunity to acquaint your ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or to wait upon Chriſt in the wayes of his appointment. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom,</hi> Col. 3.16. For it is the word and inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt which are deſigned as conduit-pipes to convey the ſpirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into mens hearts. And therefore the word hath the promiſe of converſion annexed unto it, becauſe the ſpirit of converſion worketh in, and with, and by the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul.</hi> Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will he begat us with the word of truth.</hi> As
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:64514:234"/>the word cannot work ſavingly without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current operation of the holy Ghoſt; So the holy Ghoſt doth not <hi>ordinarily</hi> work without the word: <hi>For the Goſpel is the power of God unto ſalvation, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1.16.

If you would be knit unto Jeſus, and ſo have an intereſt in him, <hi>endeavour after the uniting grace of faith in his bloud;</hi> caſt your ſelves upon his righteouſneſs for ſalvation, according to the propoſals of the Goſpel: Receive him for your Redeemer, as he is tendred therein: Believe in the name of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that you ſhould believe on him whom he hath ſent; i. e.</hi> It is a work exceedingly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God; it is the great work that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, to bring you unto his Son; that you may have life through his bloud. It is that work, that makes up the conjunction betwixt him and your ſouls. And therefore what is attributed in one place <hi>unto union with Chriſt,</hi> is in another place aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>unto faith,</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Joh. 3.18. <hi>He that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:64514:234"/>believeth on him is not condemned.</hi> Why? Becauſe it is faith which makes up the union; by believing on Chriſt we are implanted into him.

And to that purpoſe be frequent in meditation upon thoſe incouragements, which God hath given unto ſinners to quicken them to believe on the name of his Son, and to help againſt the miſgivings of their own hearts. <hi>I will inſtance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in five.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is the command of God,</hi> that which he hath left in ſpecial charge upon mens ſouls, <hi>to come unto Chriſt, that they may be ſaved.</hi> And therefore it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently followeth that he is willing you ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for it is that which he mainly deſireth, that his will be done, that his precepts be obſerved. Can you imagine that God ſhould give you a ſtrict commandment, backt with many arguments and motives, to the obſervance of it, and yet be loath you ſhould obey that commandment? <hi>This is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Christ,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God ſent his Son into the world upon this very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand and buſineſs, that he might draw ſinners unto him, in order to their ſalvation:</hi> And the Lord Jeſus took our nature upon him, and was obedient unto the death, the accurſed death of the croſs, to this very end and purpoſe, that ſinners might come unto him, and obtain eternal redemption through his bloud. And can it ever enter into your hearts to think, that God is not willing to accompliſh what he hath deſigned to bring about? or that Chriſt is not willing to attain the end of his ſufferings?
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:64514:235"/>What was the Fathers deſign in ſending Chriſt into the world? <hi>Why,</hi> that we might live through him, and that he might be a propitiation for our ſins? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10. Wherefore hath he publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel of Chriſt, and revealed the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſalvation through him? <hi>Why, Theſe things are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name,</hi> Joh. 20.31. To what end did our Saviour leave the boſom of his Father, and ſojourn amongſt us, and bear the weight of his fathers indignation? Mark what account himſelf gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of it, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12.46. <hi>I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever believeth in me ſhould not abide in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And <hi>v</hi> 47. <hi>I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> And ſpeaking of his death under the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of lifting up the brazen ſerpent in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:64514:235"/>be made worthy. Art thou apprehenſive of the neceſſity of being partaker of his death, and the merit thereof? Doſt thou hunger and thirſt after the enjoyment of him?

O but, <hi>will the ſinner reply,</hi> I have long ſtood out againſt the calls of Chriſt, and will he now receive me graciouſly if I come unto him? <hi>Why,</hi> Hear what he ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, 18, 19. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth; and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart; i. e.</hi> He withſtood chaſtizement, which is one of the loudeſt, and moſt awakening calls; in the time of his diſtreſs he ſinned yet more againſt the Lord: Inſtead of returning, he held faſt deceit, and refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: <hi>He went on frowardly,</hi> that is, perverſly, and ſtubbornly againſt all the dealings of God. And yet what followeth, <hi>v.</hi> 18? <hi>I have ſeen his wayes, and will heal him; I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comfort to him, and to his mourners.</hi> One would have expected it thus rather, I have ſeen his wayes and I will confound him, I will never more have any pity, or compaſſion upon him. <hi>Nay,</hi> but faith the gracious God, at length he mourns for ſin, and is humbled for his iniquity, and my bowels are turned within me, my repentings are kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: He is coming towards me, and I will go forth to meet him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him; I will pardon him, and guide him in the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:64514:236"/>way of conſolation and ſalvation. But what doth this concern me, <hi>will the heart of a ſinner be apt to ſuggeſt?</hi> Am I comprized in this word of comfort? Yes, if thou mourneſt for ſin, and deſireſt to give up thy ſelf unto Chriſt, and to God by him: For it is a promiſe made without limitation; theſe words are intended for the henefit both of Jews and Gentiles, v. 19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace,</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> My word ſhall be the means to convey great peace, ſpiritual peace, perfect peace, laſting, yea everlaſting peace] <hi>to him that is afar off, and to him that is neer; i. e.</hi> to the Jews, who were a people nigh unto God; and to the Gentiles when they ſhall be gathered to the Church, though at that time they were afar off; <hi>and I will heal him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But, <hi>will the ſinner ſay,</hi> I have backſliden from Chriſt, I have made many promiſes and faultered in the performance of them; I have deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revolted, after frequent vows and proteſtations of obedience; <hi>and ſhall ſuch a wretch, as I am, find favour?</hi> Obſerve the words of invitation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Return thou backſliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and will not keep an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for ever.

               <p>Take the example of <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

And yet <hi>when he humbled himſelf, and ſought the Lord, and prayed, he was intreated of him, and heard his ſupplication.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> directed the offers of ſalvation upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, unto the crucifiers of the Lord Chriſt; <hi>who denied the holy one, and the juſt, and deſired a murderer to be granted unto them, and killed the Prince of life, Act.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16, 19, 26.

               <p n="5">5. The laſt incouragement to faith, which I ſhall mention to be conſidered is this, <hi>That God is more eminently, and more abundantly glorified in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as believe in the Lord Jeſus, than in the condemnation of the impenitent and unbelievers.</hi> And therefore, without diſpute, he is willing that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould come unto the Son, that they may have life through his bloud: for it tends to the eminent advancement of his glory, which is the principal end which he aimeth at, in all his diſpenſations, and undertakings.

A little to make it appear, that it is ſo in very deed; becauſe it is a comfortable point, and may be improved as a wonderful incouragement, to ſtrengthen the hands

               </p>
               <p>God is glorified in the ſalvation of ſuch as believe, above what he is in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.

But believers are active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to render glory unto the God of heaven. Their tongues will make mention of the praiſes of his name, and ſing aloud of his righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.6. Their hearts will be filled with an holy admiration of his greatneſs, and majeſty, and wonderful goodneſs in their redemption, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>He will be glorified in his Saints, and admired in them that do believe.</hi> Their lives alſo will be fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the glory and praiſe of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is glorified upon believers <hi>in more of his attributes, and excellencies.</hi> Peculiarly, in his <hi>free grace,</hi> and <hi>tender mercy;</hi> which is the attribute that he delighteth to magnifie, and taketh ſingular pleaſure in the exerciſe of, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. God doth ſhew forth his <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> and declare his <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> in the ruine of the ungodly; but
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:64514:238"/>there are no prints or footſteps of his <hi>free grace,</hi> and <hi>compaſsion:</hi> Their portion is wrath without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. But what ſaith the Prophet of them that are ſaved? Mark that notable Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.7, 8. <hi>I will mention the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Lord, and the praiſes of the Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all that the Lord hath beſtowed upon us: and the great goodneſs towards the houſe of Iſrael, which he hath beſtowed on them, according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindneſſes. For he ſaid, ſurely they are my people, children that will not lye: So he was their Saviour.</hi> Here is a diſcovery of grace, rich inexpreſſible grace; herein is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the goodneſs of God, <hi>nay,</hi> the great goodneſſes of the Lord; here is mercy, and loving-kindneſs, yea, &amp; a multitude of mercies, &amp; loving-kindneſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſome of his attributes, <hi>God is more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently glorified, viz.</hi> in his wiſdom, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It was a work of infinite skill and wiſdom, to find out a way to redeem loſt ſinners from the jaws of eternal death: to execute vengeance upon the tranſgreſſion, and yet to ſave the tranſgreſſors. <hi>O the depth of the riches of the wiſdom, and knowledge of God! Rom.</hi> 11.33. It is a work of greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to pull a ſoul out of the hands of the Devil, than to give him over to the will of Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. Nay, the very juſtice of God is better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by believers, through their ſurety, than in the damnation of ſuch as periſh in their unbelief. Here the price paid is the death of a creature, but there the precious bloud of the Son of God, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. The wicked that periſh are ever ſatisfying, and have never given full ſatisfaction, for the wrong which they have done; their debt is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:64514:239"/>
                  <hi>as it were,</hi> by <hi>driblets:</hi> But in the behalf of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the work is compleated and finiſhed; the utmoſt farthing was paid together upon the nail; and there is nothing further to be demanded. <hi>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14. Now if God be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the ſalvation of ſuch as are in Chriſt; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he is willing that you ſhould come unto Chriſt; and is ready to receive you when ye come. So much for the third direction.</p>

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. To ſtir you up to a cloſure with this advice, and diligent proſecution of this work of getting into Chriſt; Often revolve in your thoughts, and lay ſeriouſly to heart this following conſideration, <hi>viz. That if you periſh for ever in a ſeparation from the Lord Jeſus, and for want of being in him, that you may partake of his righteouſneſs, it will wholly proceed from your own default, and your bloud will be upon your own heads.</hi> And what anguiſh and horror will this bring to thy conſcience in the day of accounts, to bethink thy ſelf thus, <hi>I might have been ſaved by the bloud of the covenant, but I would not; and now I muſt lie bound for ever in the chains of darkneſs?</hi> For it is a ſinners willful rejecting of the tenders of mercy upon the terms of the Goſpel, which is the cauſe of his falling ſhort of the mercy tendred. Although it is <hi>Gods free grace,</hi> and not <hi>mans free will,</hi> that doth conduct believers un o the kingdom of heaven; yet it is the perverſeneſs and <hi>obſtinacy of the will of unbelievers,</hi> which hindereth their deliverance from the damnation of hell, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life,</hi> Hoſ. 5.4. <hi>They will not frame their doings, to turn unto the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 18.31. <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael? q. d.</hi> If you are deſtroyed for ever,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:64514:239"/>you may thank your ſelves; you are the blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy cauſe of your own eternal ruine, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the terms on which ſalvation is offered. And <hi>I pray</hi> think of it often, what an unſpeakable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it will be to thy ſpirit for ever, to reflect upon this very thing; I have been wooed and intreated to lay down the arms of my rebellion, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the government of Chriſt, that I might be ſaved, and I would not? How often hath the ſpirit of God ſtrived with me, and I ſtill reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt? The word of God hath called upon me, and I have broken through the convictions of the word. With what confuſion wilt thou be fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſay unto thee, how often would I have gathered thee into the number of my ſervants, and thou wouldeſt not be gathered! and now depart from me thou accurſed wretch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23 37.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ended <hi>the firſt head of exhortations,</hi> directed unto the <hi>wicked,</hi> who are yet ſtrangers unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let me ſpeak unto the godly,</hi> who are through rich mercy and grace ingraffed into Chriſt, and made partakers of this priviledge of union with the Son. <hi>Be exhorted.</hi> 1. <hi>To be much in bleſsing the name of God, for his ſignal, ſaving, and differencing mercy.</hi> Adore him for advancing you to this high dignity. <hi>Behold what manner of love, the Father hath beſtowed upon you, that you ſhould be called the ſons of</hi> God! Nay, that he ſhould take you into fellowſhip with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and intimately knit you unto him! 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.1. Will you bleſs God for temporal mercies, and not be raviſhed with the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſuper-eminent bleſſing? Certainly, <hi>my brethren,</hi> eternity itſelf will be little enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:64514:240"/>the wonderful and unſearchable grace of the Lord. 2. <hi>Be exhorted,</hi> moreover, <hi>rightly to improve the conſideration of this unſpeakable gift.</hi> And that eſpecially in theſe <hi>ſix caſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Improve it <hi>in caſe of tranſgreſsions,</hi> to humble you, and to fill you with an holy ſhame and ſelf-abhorrence in the ſenſe of your miſcarriages. Not only to fill you with hatred againſt ſin, but with a loathing and deteſtation of your ſelves, becauſe of ſin. Let your thoughts be ſet on work in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical manner; <hi>Hath God advanced me to this high dignity, and ſhall I be ſo unworthy as to riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? Am I a perſon cloſely joyned unto Chriſt, and in covenant with God through Chriſt, and ſhall I walk contrary to his commandments? O the vileneſs and baſeneſs of this heart of mine, which hath thus drawn me to ſin againſt ſuch a gracious Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer!</hi> This is the great aggravation of ſin; and thus will the kindneſs of God work upon you, if you have any principles of ingenuity. As <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel's</hi> Mother pleads with him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.2. <hi>What my Son! and what the ſon of my womb! and what the ſon of my vows!

You that I have called out of the world, and marryed to my only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son! What, you that are in Chriſt, the men of my covenant, and my intimate acquaintance! will you thus rebel against me? Is this a good requital of all the love that I have ſhewed you, and the great things which I have done for you?</hi> See how this conſideration melts the hearts of believers into Evangelical ſorrow and cauſeth them to lie down in their ſhame, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant with thee,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:64514:240"/>and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord: That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>

The abſolute neceſſity of regeneration doth appear, <hi>from the infinite holineſs and purity of the God of heaven:</hi> who will never maintain any converſe, or fellowſhip with ſuch as lie dead in their ſins; nor indeed is it poſſible, they ſhould have communion with God, till they are waſhed and ſanctified. An unſanctified mind cannot behold him, an unholy will cannot enjoy him, and unholy affections can take no delight or complacency in him. <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> when perſons are called into the ſtate of the favour of God, they are called alſo unto fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him: Now, <hi>what communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> What friendly intercourſe can there be, betwixt a God of incomprehenſible purity, and ſuch whoſe ſpirits are nothing but ſinks of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Firſt you muſt be made again after the image of God, and ſo fitted for acquaintance with the moſt high: for God is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity, and he hateth all the workers of it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Without a principle of grace planted in the heart,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:64514:243"/>there can be no fruits of new obedience brought forth in the life:</hi> which are of indiſpenſable neceſſity to our getting ſafe to heaven. Such as are ſaved by the Lord, muſt be ſerviceable unto him; for Chriſt will judge us hereafter according to our converſations here. <hi>As a man ſoweth, that he ſhall alſo reap, Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. Now except you be regenerate, you cannot walk in a courſe of new obedience. Firſt there muſt be a good treaſure in the heart, before it can be productive of what is good in the life. <hi>As the principles are, ſo the practiſe will be,</hi> Mat. 12.33, 34, 35. Beſides, God doith judge of mens works and deeds, by the frame of their hearts in the doing of them. He doth ſearch the heart, and try the reins, that he may give to every man according to his wayes, and according to the fruit of his doings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The indiſpenſable neceſſity of regeneration doth ariſe, <hi>from the influence it hath to unite a ſinner unto Chriſt:</hi> without having of whom, there is no partaking of life through his bloud. The day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is the day of eſpouſals, between the Lord Jeſus and his people. It is that which helpeth to make the marriage betwixt them: <hi>For if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>the firſt Leſſon,</hi> I would from hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your ſtudy and meditation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Learn from this point of a Believers union with Chriſt, <hi>What is the influence of faith in the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a ſinner;</hi> or in what ſenſe it is ſaid to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us in the ſight of God. Not by any inherent worth and vertue in it ſelf; but becauſe it is the bond that knitteth a ſinner to Chriſt, by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of whoſe righteouſneſs we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:64514:244"/>If we are juſtified, it is freely by the grace of God, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt Jeſus: Only the grace of faith is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and the bond of our union with him, that ſo we may partake of that redemption,

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Set upon the diſcharge of thoſe duties, which are upon this account to be diſcharged.</hi> That is to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Bleſs the Lord for the manifeſtation of this great myſtery,</hi> and that your lot is fallen in ſuch times, and places, when and where it is diſcovered, and ſet open before your eyes. For, as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>It is a myſtery which hath been kept hid from ages,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:64514:244"/>and generations, but is now made manifeſt unto his Saints: To whom God would make known, what is the riches of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory. Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, Col.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adore the condeſcention and grace of our Lord Jeſus:</hi> who was pleaſed to humble himſelf to come down to us, that we might be exalted unto a ſtate of oneneſs with him. Eſpecially if thou art par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of this grace, how ſhould thy heart be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed in the contemplation of it? Thou ſhouldſt be ready to cry out with an holy aſtoniſhment of Spirit, as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, my Redeemer, and my Saviour?</hi> Where is any lovelineſs in my perſon? or what have I deſerved at thy hands, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, that you do not fall ſhort of this grace and priviledge.</hi> Labour every day more and more to clear it up, to the conſolation of your hearts, <hi>that you have the Son, by being united unto the Son.</hi> And to that purpoſe (beſides what hath been mentioned already) ſeriouſly weigh and ponder theſe three further <hi>evidential properties</hi> of ſuch as are in Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you be knit unto Chriſt, <hi>you will be ſharers with him in all his concernments.</hi> You will be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with his intereſt and affairs, as if it were your own. If Chriſt be advanced, it will rejoyce your hearts: and if his name be diſhonoured, or his glory be ecclipſed, it will bring trouble and ſadneſs upon your ſpirits. If you are in Chriſt, you will
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:64514:245"/>joyn intereſts with him, and you will have
<note n="*" place="margin">Amici ſunt qui ſimul laetantur commodis &amp; contriſtantur ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis: quibus eadem bona &amp; malae ſunt; &amp; qui ſunt iiſdem amici &amp; inimici.</note> common friends and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies with the Lord Jeſus. You will be able to ſay in a meaſure with <hi>Paul,</hi> it matters not what becomes of my ſecular concernments, ſo that Chriſt be magnified, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. And with <hi>David, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Do not I hate them that hate thee, O Lord? Am not I grieved with them that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies, Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you are ingraffed into Chriſt, <hi>you will not walk in any way of ungodlineſs whatſoever. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever abideth in him, ſinneth not; i.e.</hi> he doth not ſin allowedly and preſumptuouſly, at the rate as wicked men ſin. Compare 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, If you are united to the Son of God, <hi>you will not only readily cloſe with his word, but continue ſtedfaſt and unmoveable therein unto the end,</hi> Joh. 15.7. <hi>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Whoſo keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: Hereby we know that we are in him.</hi> Whoſo keepeth his word] <hi>that is,</hi> he that hideth it as a treaſure in his heart; and walketh by the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it in his wayes; and will not part with the word, nor with the way of holineſs therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, notwithſtanding all aſſaults and opp ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men and devils. <hi>In him verily is the love of God perfected</hi>] <hi>i.e.</hi> then it doth appear to be love of the right kind; and then it hath attained its end, which is the perfection of it: For to this end
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:64514:245"/>is the grace of love planted in the hearts of Chriſts ſeed, that they may cheerfully obey his word and precepts, and ſtick cloſe thereunto at all times and ſeaſons. <hi>Hereby we know that we are in him</hi>] that is, If we keep his word, and ſtedfaſtly cleave unto Chriſt, and to the doctrines which he hath taught. For, as it is in the <hi>ſecond Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God: He that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, he both hath the Father and the Son.</hi>
